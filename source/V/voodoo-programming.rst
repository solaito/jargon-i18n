voodoo programming
============================================================

n\.

[from George Bush Sr.'s "voodoo economics"]

1.
   The use by guess or cookbook of an :ref:`obscure` or :ref:`hairy` system, feature, or algorithm that one does not truly understand.
   The implication is that the technique may not work, and if it doesn't, one will never know why.
   Almost synonymous with :ref:`black-magic`\, except that black magic typically isn't documented and *nobody* understands it.
   Compare :ref:`magic`\, :ref:`deep-magic`\, :ref:`heavy-wizardry`\, :ref:`rain-dance`\, :ref:`cargo-cult-programming`\, :ref:`wave-a-dead-chicken`\, :ref:`SCSI-voodoo`\.

2.
   Things programmers do that they know shouldn't work but they try anyway, and which sometimes actually work, such as recompiling everything.
