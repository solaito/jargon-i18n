n\.

[Usenet: by analogy with :ref:`spam`\.
The trade name Velveeta is attached in the U.S. to a particularly nasty processed-cheese spread.]
Also knows as :ref:`ECP`\; a message that is excessively cross-posted, as opposed to :ref:`spam` which is too frequently posted.
This term is widely recognized but not commonly used; most people refer to both kinds of abuse as spam.
Compare :ref:`jello`\.
