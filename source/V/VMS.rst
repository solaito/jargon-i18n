VMS

/V·M·S/, n\.

:ref:`DEC`\'s proprietary operating system for its :ref:`VAX` minicomputer; one of the seven or so environments that loom largest in hacker folklore.
Many Unix fans generously concede that VMS would probably be the hacker's favorite commercial OS if Unix didn't exist; though true, this makes VMS fans furious.
One major hacker gripe with VMS concerns its slowness — thus the following limerick:

.. code-block:: none


      There once was a system called VMS
      Of cycles by no means abstemious.
           It's chock-full of hacks
           And runs on a VAX
      And makes my poor stomach all squeamious.
                                       — The Great Quux
