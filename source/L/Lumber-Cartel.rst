Lumber Cartel

n\.

A mythical conspiracy accused by :ref:`spam`\-spewers of funding anti-spam activism in order to force the direct-mail promotions industry back onto paper.
Hackers, predictably, responded by forming a "Lumber Cartel" spoofing this paranoid theory; the web page is `http://come.to/the.lumber.cartel/ <http://come.to/the.lumber.cartel/>`_.
Members often include the tag TINLC ("There Is No Lumber Cartel") in their postings; see :ref:`TINC`\, :ref:`backbone-cabal` and :ref:`NANA` for explanation.
