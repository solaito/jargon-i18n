adj\.

Describes a computer architecture in which, within a given 16- or 32-bit word, bytes at lower addresses have lower significance (the word is stored ‘little-end-first’).
The :ref:`PDP-11` and :ref:`VAX` families of computers and Intel microprocessors and a lot of communications and networking hardware are little-endian.
See :ref:`big-endian`\, :ref:`middle-endian`\, :ref:`NUXI-problem`\.
The term is sometimes used to describe the ordering of units other than bytes; most often, bits within a byte.
