============================================================

[from Unix's :manpage:`lint(1)`\, named for the bits of fluff it supposedly picks from programs]

1. vt\.
   To examine a program closely for style, language usage, and portability problems, esp.
   if in C, esp.
   if via use of automated analysis tools, most esp.
   if the Unix utility :manpage:`lint(1)` is used.
   This term used to be restricted to use of :manpage:`lint(1)` itself, but (judging by references on Usenet) it has become a shorthand for any exhaustive review process at some non-Unix shops, even in languages other than C. Also as v. :ref:`delint`\.

2. n\.
   Excess verbiage in a document, as in "This draft has too much lint".
