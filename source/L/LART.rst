Luser Attitude Readjustment Tool.

1. n\.
   In the collective mythos of :ref:`scary-devil-monastery`\, this is an essential item in the toolkit of every :ref:`BOFH`\.
   The LART classic is a 2x4 or other large billet of wood usable as a club, to be applied upside the head of spammers and other people who cause sysadmins more grief than just naturally goes with the job.
   Perennial debates rage on :samp:`alt.sysadmin.recovery` over what constitutes the truly effective LART; knobkerries, automatic weapons, flamethrowers, and tactical nukes all have their partisans.
   Compare :ref:`clue-by-four`\.

2. v\.
   To use a LART.
   Some would add "in malice", but some sysadmins do prefer to gently lart their users as a first (and sometimes final) warning.

3. interj.
   Calling for one's LART, much as a surgeon might call "Scalpel!
   ".

4. interj.
   [rare] Used in :ref:`flame`\s as a rebuke.
   "LART!
   LART!
   LART!"
