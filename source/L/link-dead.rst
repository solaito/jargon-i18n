adj\.

[MUD] The state a player is in when they kill their connection to a :ref:`MUD` without leaving it properly.
The player is then commonly left as a statue in the game, and is only removed after a certain period of time (an hour on most MUDs).
Used on :ref:`IRC` as well, although it is inappropriate in that context.
Compare :ref:`netdead`\.
