[from ‘LISt Processing language’, but mythically from ‘Lots of Irritating Superfluous Parentheses’] AI's mother tongue, a language based on the ideas of (a) variable-length lists and trees as fundamental data types, and (b) the interpretation of code as data and vice-versa.
Invented by John McCarthy at MIT in the late 1950s, it is actually older than any other :ref:`HLL` still in use except FORTRAN.
Accordingly, it has undergone considerable adaptive radiation over the years; modern variants are quite different in detail from the original LISP 1.5.
The dominant HLL among hackers until the early 1980s, LISP has since shared the throne with :ref:`C`\.
Its partisans claim it is the only language that is truly beautiful.
See :ref:`languages-of-choice`\.

All LISP functions and programs are expressions that return values; this, together with the high memory utilization of LISPs, gave rise to Alan Perlis's famous quip (itself a take on an Oscar Wilde quote) that "LISP programmers know the value of everything and the cost of nothing".

One significant application for LISP has been as a proof by example that most newer languages, such as :ref:`COBOL` and Ada, are full of unnecessary :ref:`crock`\s.
When the :ref:`Right-Thing` has already been done once, there is no justification for :ref:`bogosity` in newer languages.
