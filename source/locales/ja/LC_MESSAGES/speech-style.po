"Hackish speech generally features extremely precise diction, careful word"
" choice, a relatively large working vocabulary, and relatively little use"
" of contractions or street slang. Dry humor, irony, puns, and a mildly "
"flippant attitude are highly valued — but an underlying seriousness and "
"intelligence are essential. One should use just enough jargon to "
"communicate precisely and identify oneself as a member of the culture; "
"overuse of jargon or a breathless, excessively gung-ho attitude is "
"considered tacky and the mark of a loser."

"This speech style is a variety of the precisionist English normally "
"spoken by scientists, design engineers, and academics in technical "
"fields. In contrast with the methods of jargon construction, it is fairly"
" constant throughout hackerdom."

"It has been observed that many hackers are confused by negative questions"
" — or, at least, that the people to whom they are talking are often "
"confused by the sense of their answers. The problem is that they have "
"done so much programming that distinguishes between"

"that when they parse the question \"Aren't you going?\" it may seem to be"
" asking the opposite question from \"Are you going? \", and so to merit "
"an answer in the opposite sense. This confuses English-speaking non-"
"hackers because they were taught to answer as though the negative part "
"weren't there. In some other languages (including Russian, Chinese, and "
"Japanese) the hackish interpretation is standard and the problem wouldn't"
" arise. Hackers often find themselves wishing for a word like French "
"‘si’, German ‘doch’, or Dutch ‘jawel’ — a word with which one could "
"unambiguously answer ‘yes’ to a negative question. (See also :ref:`mu`\\)"

"For similar reasons, English-speaking hackers almost never use double "
"negatives, even if they live in a region where colloquial usage allows "
"them. The thought of uttering something that logically ought to be an "
"affirmative knowing it will be misparsed as a negative tends to disturb "
"them."

"In a related vein, hackers sometimes make a game of answering questions "
"containing logical connectives with a strictly literal rather than "
"colloquial interpretation. A non-hacker who is indelicate enough to ask a"
" question like \"So, are you working on finding that bug now or leaving "
"it until later?\" is likely to get the perfectly correct answer \"Yes!\" "
"(that is, \"Yes, I'm doing it either now or later, and you didn't ask "
"which! \")."
