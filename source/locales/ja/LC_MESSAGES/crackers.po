"From the early 1980s onward, a flourishing culture of local, MS-DOS-based"
" bulletin boards developed separately from Internet hackerdom. The BBS "
"culture has, as its seamy underside, a stratum of ‘pirate boards’ "
"inhabited by :ref:`cracker`\\s, phone phreaks, and :ref:`warez-d00dz`\\. "
"These people (mostly teenagers running IBM-PC clones from their bedrooms)"
" have developed their own characteristic jargon, heavily influenced by "
"skateboard lingo and underground-rock slang. While BBS technology "
"essentially died out after the :ref:`Great-Internet-Explosion`\\, the "
"cracker culture moved to IRC and other Internet-based network channels "
"and maintained a semi-underground existence."

"Though crackers often call themselves ‘hackers’, they aren't (they "
"typically have neither significant programming ability, nor Internet "
"expertise, nor experience with UNIX or other true multi-user systems). "
"Their vocabulary has little overlap with hackerdom's, and hackers regard "
"them with varying degrees of contempt. But ten years on the brightest "
"crackers tend to become hackers, and sometimes to recall their origins by"
" using cracker slang in a marked and heavily ironic way."

"Always substitute ‘z’s for ‘s’s. (i.e. \"codes\" → \"codez\"). The "
"substitution of ‘z’ for ‘s’ has evolved so that a ‘z’ is now "
"systematically put at the end of words to denote an illegal or cracking "
"connection. Examples : Appz, passwordz, passez, utilz, MP3z, distroz, "
"pornz, sitez, gamez, crackz, serialz, downloadz, FTPz, etc."
