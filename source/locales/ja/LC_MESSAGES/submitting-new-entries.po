"We are looking to expand the File's range of technical specialties "
"covered. There are doubtless rich veins of jargon yet untapped in the "
"scientific computing, graphics, and networking hacker communities; also "
"in numerical analysis, computer architectures and VLSI design, language "
"design, and many other related fields. Send us your jargon!"

"We are *not* interested in straight technical terms explained by "
"textbooks or technical dictionaries unless an entry illuminates "
"‘underground’ meanings or aspects not covered by official histories. We "
"are also not interested in ‘joke’ entries — there is a lot of humor in "
"the file but it must flow naturally out of the explanations of what "
"hackers do and how they think."

"It is OK to submit items of jargon you have originated if they have "
"spread to the point of being used by people who are not personally "
"acquainted with you. We prefer items to be attested by independent "
"submission from two different sites."
