"If you are a writer or journalist, don't say or write :ref:`hacker` when "
"you mean :ref:`cracker`\\. If you work with writers or journalists, "
"educate them on this issue and push them to do the right thing. If you "
"catch a newspaper or magazine abusing the word ‘hacker’, write them and "
"straighten them out (this appendix includes a model letter)."

"If you're a techie or computer hobbyist, get involved with one of the "
"free Unixes. Toss out that lame Microsoft OS, or confine it to one disk "
"partition and put Linux or FreeBSD or NetBSD on the other one. And the "
"next time your friend or boss is thinking about some proprietary software"
" ‘solution’ that costs more than it's worth, be ready to blow the "
"competition away with open-source software running over a Unix."

"Here's the text of a letter RMS wrote to the Wall Street Journal to "
"complain about their policy of using \"hacker\" only in a pejorative "
"sense. We hear that most major newspapers have the same policy. If you'd "
"like to help change this situation, send your favorite newspaper the same"
" letter — or, better yet, write your own letter."
