"Casual, vaguely post-hippie; T-shirts, jeans, running shoes, Birk-"
"enstocks (or bare feet). Long hair, beards, and moustaches are common. "
"High incidence of tie-dye and intellectual or humorous ‘slogan’ T-shirts."
" Until the mid-1990s such T-shirts were seldom computer-related, as that "
"would have been too obvious — but the hacker culture has since developed "
"its own icons, and J. Random Hacker now often wears a Linux penguin or "
"BSD daemon or a DeCSS protest shirt."

"A substantial minority prefers ‘outdoorsy’ clothing — hiking boots (\"in "
"case a mountain should suddenly spring up in the machine room\", as one "
"famous parody put it), khakis, lumberjack or chamois shirts, and the "
"like."

"After about 1995 hacker dress styles assimilated some influence from "
"punk, gothic, and rave subcultures. This was relatively mild and has "
"manifested mostly as a tendency to wear a lot of black, especially when "
"‘dressed up’ to the limit of formality. Other markers of those "
"subcultures such as piercings, chains, and dyed hair remain relatively "
"uncommon. Hackers appear to wear black more because it goes with "
"everything and hides dirt than because they want to look like goths."

"Very few hackers actually fit the *NationalLampoon* Nerd stereotype, "
"though it lingers on at MIT and may have been more common before 1975. At"
" least since the late Seventies backpacks have been more common than "
"briefcases, and the hacker ‘look’ has been more whole-earth than whole-"
"polyester."

"Hackers dress for comfort, function, and minimal maintenance hassles "
"rather than for appearance (some, perhaps unfortunately, take this to "
"extremes and neglect personal hygiene). They have a very low tolerance of"
" suits and other ‘business’ attire; in fact, it is not uncommon for "
"hackers to quit a job rather than conform to a dress code. When they are "
"somehow backed into conforming to a dress code, they will find ways to "
"subvert it, for example by wearing absurd novelty ties."
