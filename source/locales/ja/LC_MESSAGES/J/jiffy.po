"The duration of one tick of the system clock on your computer (see "
":ref:`tick`\\). Often one AC cycle time (1/60 second in the U.S. and "
"Canada, 1/50 most other places), but more recently 1/100 sec has become "
"common. \"The swapper runs every 6 jiffies\" means that the virtual "
"memory management routine is executed once for every 6 ticks of the "
"clock, or about ten times a second."

"Even more confusingly, physicists semi-jokingly use ‘jiffy’ to mean the "
"time required for light to travel one foot in a vacuum, which turns out "
"to be close to one *nanosecond*\\. Other physicists use the term for the "
"quantum-nechanical lower bound on meaningful time lengths,"

"Indeterminate time from a few seconds to forever. \"I'll do it in a "
"jiffy\" means certainly not now and possibly never. This is a bit "
"contrary to the more widespread use of the word. Oppose :ref:`nano`\\. "
"See also :ref:`Real-Soon-Now`\\."
