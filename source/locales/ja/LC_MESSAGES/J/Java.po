"An object-oriented language originally developed at Sun by James Gosling "
"(and known by the name \"Oak\") with the intention of being the successor"
" to :ref:`C-plus-plus` (the project was however originally sold to Sun as"
" an embedded language for use in set-top boxes). After the great Internet"
" explosion of 1993-1994, Java was hacked into a byte-interpreted language"
" and became the focus of a relentless hype campaign by Sun, which touted "
"it as the new language of choice for distributed applications."

"Java is indeed a stronger and cleaner design than C++ and has been "
"embraced by many in the hacker community â€” but it has been a considerable"
" source of frustration to many others, for reasons ranging from uneven "
"support on different Web browser platforms, performance issues, and some "
"notorious deficiencies in some of the standard toolkits (AWT in "
"particular). :ref:`Microsoft`\\'s determined attempts to corrupt the "
"language (which it rightly sees as a threat to its OS monopoly) have not "
"helped. As of 2003, these issues are still in the process of being "
"resolved."

"Despite many attractive features and a good design, it is difficult to "
"find people willing to praise Java who have tried to implement a complex,"
" real-world system with it (but to be fair it is early days yet, and no "
"other language has ever been forced to spend its childhood under the "
"limelight the way Java has). On the other hand, Java has already been a "
"big :ref:`win` in academic circles, where it has taken the place of "
":ref:`Pascal` as the preferred tool for teaching the basics of good "
"programming to the next generation of hackers."
