"The spiritual successor to :ref:`B1FF` and the archetype of :ref:`script-"
"kiddies`\\. Jeff K. is a sixteen-year-old suburbanite who fancies himself"
" a \"l33t haX0r\", although his knowledge of computers seems to be "
"limited to the procedure for getting Quake up and running. His Web page "
"`http://www.somethingawful.com/jeffk/ "
"<http://www.somethingawful.com/jeffk/>`_\\  features a number of "
"hopelessly naive articles, essays, and rants, all filled with the kind of"
" misspellings, :ref:`studlycaps`\\, and number-for-letter substitutions "
"endemic to the script kiddie and :ref:`warez-d00dz` communities. Jeff's "
"offerings, among other things, include hardware advice (such as \"AMD "
"VERSIS PENTIUM\" and \"HOW TO OVARCLOAK YOUR COMPUTAR\"), his own Quake "
"clan (Clan 40 OUNSCE), and his own comic strip (Wacky Fun Computar Comic "
"Jokes)."

"Like B1FF, Jeff K. is (fortunately) a hoax. Jeff K. was created by "
"internet game journalist Richard \"Lowtax\" Kyanka, whose web site "
"Something Awful (http://www.somethingawful.com) highlights "
"unintentionally humorous news items and Web sites, as a parody of the "
"kind of teenage :ref:`luser` who infests Quake servers, chat rooms, and "
"other places where computer enthusiasts congregate. He is well-recognized"
" in the PC game community and his influence has spread to hacker "
":ref:`fora` like Slashdot as well."
