"[Usenet: by analogy with :ref:`spam`\\] A message that is both "
"excessively cross-posted and too frequently posted, as opposed to "
":ref:`spam` (which is merely too frequently posted) or :ref:`velveeta` "
"(which is merely excessively cross-posted). This term is widely "
"recognized but not commonly used; most people refer to both kinds of "
"abuse or their combination as spam."
