"Synonymous with :ref:`IYFEG`\\. At one time, people in the Usenet "
"newsgroup :samp:`rec.humor.funny` tended to use ‘JEDR’ instead of "
":ref:`IYFEG` or ‘<ethnic>’; this stemmed from a public attempt to "
"suppress the group once made by a loser with initials JEDR after he was "
"offended by an ethnic joke posted there. (The practice was "
":ref:`retcon`\\ned by expanding these initials as ‘Joke "
"Ethnic/Denomination/Race’.) After much sound and fury JEDR faded away; "
"this term appears to be doing likewise. JEDR's only permanent effect on "
"the net.culture was to discredit ‘sensitivity’ arguments for censorship "
"so thoroughly that more recent attempts to raise them have met with "
"immediate and near-universal rejection."
