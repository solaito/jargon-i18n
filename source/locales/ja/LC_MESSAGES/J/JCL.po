"IBM's supremely :ref:`rude` Job Control Language. JCL is the script "
"language used to control the execution of programs in IBM's batch "
"systems. JCL has a very :ref:`fascist` syntax, and some versions will, "
"for example, :ref:`barf` if two spaces appear where it expects one. Most "
"programmers confronted with JCL simply copy a working file (or card "
"deck), changing the file names. Someone who actually understands and "
"generates unique JCL is regarded with the mixed respect one gives to "
"someone who memorizes the phone book. It is reported that hackers at IBM "
"itself sometimes sing \"Who's the breeder of the crud that mangles you "
"and me? I-B-M, J-C-L, M-o-u-s-e\" to the tune of the *Mickey Mouse Club* "
"theme to express their opinion of the beast."

"A comparative for any very :ref:`rude` software that a hacker is expected"
" to use. \"That's as bad as JCL.\" As with :ref:`COBOL`\\, JCL is often "
"used as an archetype of ugliness even by those who haven't experienced "
"it. See also :ref:`IBM`\\, :ref:`fear-and-loathing`\\."
