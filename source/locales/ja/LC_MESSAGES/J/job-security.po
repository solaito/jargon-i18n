"When some piece of code is written in a particularly :ref:`obscure` "
"fashion, and no good reason (such as time or space optimization) can be "
"discovered, it is often said that the programmer was attempting to "
"increase his job security (i.e., by making himself indispensable for "
"maintenance). This sour joke seldom has to be said in full; if two "
"hackers are looking over some code together and one points at a section "
"and says \"job security\", the other one may just nod."
