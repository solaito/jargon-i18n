"[very common] A mythical figure like the Unknown Soldier; the archetypal "
"hacker nerd. This term is one of the oldest in the jargon, apparently "
"going back to MIT in the 1960s. See :ref:`random`\\, :ref:`Suzie-"
"COBOL`\\. This may originally have been inspired by ‘J. Fred Muggs’, a "
"show-biz chimpanzee whose name was a household word back in the early "
"days of :ref:`TMRC`\\, and was probably influenced by ‘J. Presper Eckert’"
" (one of the co-inventors of the electronic computer). See also :ref"
":`Fred-Foobar`\\."
