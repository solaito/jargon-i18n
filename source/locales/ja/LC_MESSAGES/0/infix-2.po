"In translation software written by hackers, infix 2 often represents the "
"syllable *to* with the connotation ‘translate to’: as in dvi2ps (DVI to "
"PostScript), int2string (integer to string), and texi2roff (Texinfo to "
"[nt]roff). Several versions of a joke have floated around the internet in"
" which some idiot programmer fixes the Y2K bug by changing all the Y's in"
" something to K's, as in Januark, Februark, etc."
