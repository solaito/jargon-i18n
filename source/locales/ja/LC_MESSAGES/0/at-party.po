"[from the \\@-sign in an Internet address] (alt. : ‘\\@-sign party’ "
"/at´si:n par\\`tee/) A semi-closed party thrown for hackers at a science-"
"fiction convention (esp. the annual World Science Fiction Convention or "
"\"Worldcon\"); one must have a :ref:`network-address` to get in, or at "
"least be in company with someone who does. One of the most reliable "
"opportunities for hackers to meet face to face with people who might "
"otherwise be represented by mere phosphor dots on their screens. Compare "
":ref:`boink`\\."

"The first recorded \\@-party was held at the Westercon (a U.S. western "
"regional SF convention) over the July 4th weekend in 1980. It is not "
"clear exactly when the canonical \\@-party venue shifted to the Worldcon "
"but it had certainly become established by Constellation in 1983. Sadly, "
"the \\@-party tradition has been in decline since about 1996, mainly "
"because having an \\@-address no longer functions as an effective lodge "
"pin."
