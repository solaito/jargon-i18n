"A message, graphic, or sound effect emitted by a program (or, on a PC, "
"the BIOS ROM) in response to some undocumented set of commands or "
"keystrokes, intended as a joke or to display program credits. One well-"
"known early Easter egg found in a couple of OSes caused them to respond "
"to the command :code:`make love` with :code:`not war?`\\. Many personal "
"computers have much more elaborate eggs hidden in ROM, including lists of"
" the developers' names, political exhortations, snatches of music, and "
"(in one case) graphics images of the entire development team."
