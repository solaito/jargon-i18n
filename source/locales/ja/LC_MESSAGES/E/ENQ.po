"[from the ASCII mnemonic ENQuire for 0000101] An on-line convention for "
"querying someone's availability. After opening a :ref:`talk-mode` "
"connection to someone apparently in heavy hack mode, one might type "
":code:`SYN SYN ENQ?` (the SYNs representing notional synchronization "
"bytes), and expect a return of :ref:`ACK` or :ref:`NAK` depending on "
"whether or not the person felt interruptible. Compare :ref:`ping`\\, "
":ref:`finger`\\, and the usage of :code:`FOO?` listed under :ref:`talk-"
"mode`\\."
