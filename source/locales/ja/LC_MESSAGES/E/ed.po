"\"ed is the standard text editor.\" Line taken from the original "
":ref:`Unix` manual page on ed, an ancient line-oriented editor that is by"
" now used only by a few :ref:`Real-Programmer`\\s, and even then only for"
" batch operations. The original line is sometimes uttered near the "
"beginning of an emacs vs. vi holy war on :ref:`Usenet`\\, with the (vain)"
" hope to quench the discussion before it really takes off. Often followed"
" by a standard text describing the many virtues of ed (such as the small "
"memory :ref:`footprint` on a Timex Sinclair, and the consistent (because "
"nearly non-existent) user interface)."
