"The road mundanely called El Camino Real, running along San Francisco "
"peninsula. It originally extended all the way down to Mexico City; many "
"portions of the old road are still intact. Navigation on the San "
"Francisco peninsula is usually done relative to El Camino Real, which "
"defines :ref:`logical` north and south even though it isn't really north-"
"south in many places. El Camino Real runs right past Stanford University "
"and so is familiar to hackers."

"The Spanish word ‘real’ (which has two syllables: /ray·ahl´/) means "
"‘royal’; El Camino Real is ‘the royal road’. In the FORTRAN language, a "
"real quantity is a number typically precise to seven significant digits, "
"and a double precision quantity is a larger floating-point number, "
"precise to perhaps fourteen significant digits (other languages have "
"similar real types)."

"When a hacker from MIT visited Stanford in 1976, he remarked what a long "
"road El Camino Real was. Making a pun on ‘real’, he started calling it "
"‘El Camino Double Precision’ — but when the hacker was told that the road"
" was hundreds of miles long, he renamed it ‘El Camino Bignum’, and that "
"name has stuck. (See :ref:`bignum`\\.)"

"Mathematically literate hackers in the Valley have also been heard to "
"refer to some major cross-street intersecting El Camino Real as \"El "
"Camino Imaginary\". One popular theory is that the intersection is "
"located near Moffett Field — where they keep all those complex planes."
