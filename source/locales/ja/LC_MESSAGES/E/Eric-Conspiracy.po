"A shadowy group of mustachioed hackers named Eric first pinpointed as a "
"sinister conspiracy by an infamous :samp:`talk.bizarre` posting ca. 1987;"
" this was doubtless influenced by the numerous ‘Eric’ jokes in the Monty "
"Python oeuvre. There do indeed seem to be considerably more mustachioed "
"Erics in hackerdom than the frequency of these three traits can account "
"for unless they are correlated in some arcane way. Well-known examples "
"include Eric Allman (he of the ‘Allman style’ described under :ref"
":`indent-style`\\) and Erik Fair (co-author of NNTP); your editor has "
"heard from more than a hundred others by email, and the organization line"
" ‘Eric Conspiracy Secret Laboratories’ now emanates regularly from more "
"than one site. See the Eric Conspiracy Web Page at "
"`http://www.catb.org/~esr/ecsl/ <http://www.catb.org/~esr/ecsl/>`_\\  for"
" full details."
