"[abbreviation, Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code] An alleged"
" character set used on IBM :ref:`dinosaur`\\s. It exists in at least six "
"mutually incompatible versions, all featuring such delights as non-"
"contiguous letter sequences and the absence of several ASCII punctuation "
"characters fairly important for modern computer languages (exactly which "
"characters are absent varies according to which version of EBCDIC you're "
"looking at). IBM adapted EBCDIC from :ref:`punched-card` code in the "
"early 1960s and promulgated it as a customer-control tactic (see :ref"
":`connector-conspiracy`\\), spurning the already established ASCII "
"standard. Today, IBM claims to be an open-systems company, but IBM's own "
"description of the EBCDIC variants and how to convert between them is "
"still internally classified top-secret, burn-before-reading. Hackers "
"blanch at the very *name* of EBCDIC and consider it a manifestation of "
"purest :ref:`evil`\\. See also :ref:`fear-and-loathing`\\."
