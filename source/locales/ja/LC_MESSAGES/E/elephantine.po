"Used of programs or systems that are both conspicuous :ref:`hog`\\s "
"(owing perhaps to poor design founded on :ref:`brute-force-and-"
"ignorance`\\) and exceedingly :ref:`hairy` in source form. An elephantine"
" program may be functional and even friendly, but (as in the old joke "
"about being in bed with an elephant) it's tough to have around all the "
"same (and, like a pachyderm, difficult to maintain). In extreme cases, "
"hackers have been known to make trumpeting sounds or perform expressive "
"proboscatory mime at the mention of the offending program. Usage: semi-"
"humorous. Compare ‘has the elephant nature’ and the somewhat more "
"pejorative :ref:`monstrosity`\\. See also :ref:`second-system-effect` and"
" :ref:`baroque`\\."
