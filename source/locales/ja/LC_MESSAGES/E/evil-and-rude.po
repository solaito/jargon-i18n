"Both :ref:`evil` and :ref:`rude`\\, but with the additional connotation "
"that the rudeness was due to malice rather than incompetence. Thus, for "
"example: Microsoft's Windows NT is *evil* because it's a competent "
"implementation of a bad design; it's *rude* because it's gratuitously "
"incompatible with Unix in places where compatibility would have been as "
"easy and effective to do; but it's *evil and rude* because the "
"incompatibilities are apparently there not to fix design bugs in Unix but"
" rather to lock hapless customers and developers into the Microsoft way. "
"Hackish *evil and rude* is close to the mainstream sense of ‘evil’."
