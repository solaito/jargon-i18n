"A generic obscenity that quickly entered wide use on the Internet and "
"Usenet after the passage of the Communications Decency Act. From the last"
" name of Senator James Exon (Democrat-Nebraska), primary author of the "
":ref:`CDA`\\. This usage outlasted the CDA itself, which was quashed a "
"little over a year later by one of the most acerbic pro-free-speech "
"opinions ever uttered by the Supreme Court. The campaign against it was "
"led by an alliance of hackers and civil libertarians, and was the first "
"effective political mobilization of the hacker culture. Use of Exon's "
"name as an expletive outlived the CDA controversy itself."
