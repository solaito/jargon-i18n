"The Tengwar of Feanor, a table of letterforms resembling the beautiful "
"Celtic half-uncial hand of the *Book of Kells*\\. Invented and described "
"by J. R. R. Tolkien in *The Lord of The Rings* as an orthography for his "
"fictional ‘elvish’ languages, this system (which is both visually and "
"phonetically :ref:`elegant`\\) has long fascinated hackers (who tend to "
"be intrigued by artificial languages in general). It is traditional for "
"graphics printers, plotters, window systems, and the like to support a "
"Feanorian typeface as one of their demo items. See also :ref:`elder-"
"days`\\."
