"To exchange two things, each for the other; to swap places. If you point "
"to two people sitting down and say \"Exch! \", you are asking them to "
"trade places. EXCH, meaning EXCHange, was originally the name of a PDP-10"
" instruction that exchanged the contents of a register and a memory "
"location. Many newer hackers are probably thinking instead of the "
":ref:`PostScript` exchange operator (which is usually written in "
"lowercase)."
