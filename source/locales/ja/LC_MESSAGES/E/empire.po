"Any of a family of military simulations derived from a game written by "
"Peter Langston many years ago. A number of multi-player variants of "
"varying degrees of sophistication exist, and one single-player version "
"implemented for both Unix and VMS; the latter is even available as MS-"
"DOS/Windows freeware. All are notoriously addictive. Of various "
"commercial derivatives the best known is probably \"Empire Deluxe\" on "
"PCs and Amigas."

"Modern empire is a real-time wargame played over the internet by up to "
"120 players. Typical games last from 24 hours (blitz) to a couple of "
"months (long term). The amount of sleep you can get while playing is a "
"function of the rate at which updates occur and the number of co-rulers "
"of your country. Empire server software is available for Unix-like "
"machines, and clients for Unix and other platforms. A comprehensive "
"history of the game is available at "
"`http://www.empire.cx/infopages/History.html "
"<http://www.wolfpackempire.com/infopages/History.html>`_. The Empire "
"resource site is at `http://www.empire.cx/ <http://www.empire.cx/>`_."
