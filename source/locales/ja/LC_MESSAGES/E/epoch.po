"[Unix: prob. : from astronomical timekeeping] The time and date "
"corresponding to 0 in an operating system's clock and timestamp values. "
"Under most Unix versions the epoch is 00:00:00 GMT, January 1, 1970; "
"under VMS, it's 00:00:00 of November 17, 1858 (base date of the U.S. "
"Naval Observatory's ephemerides); on a Macintosh, it's the midnight "
"beginning January 1 1904. System time is measured in seconds or "
":ref:`tick`\\s past the epoch. Weird problems may ensue when the clock "
"wraps around (see :ref:`wrap-around`\\), which is not necessarily a rare "
"event; on systems counting 10 ticks per second, a signed 32-bit count of "
"ticks is good only for 6.8 years. The 1-tick-per-second clock of Unix is "
"good only until January 18, 2038, assuming at least some software "
"continues to consider it signed and that word lengths don't increase by "
"then. See also :ref:`wall-time`\\. Microsoft Windows, on the other hand, "
"has an epoch problem every 49.7 days â€” but this is seldom noticed as "
"Windows is almost incapable of staying up continuously for that long."
