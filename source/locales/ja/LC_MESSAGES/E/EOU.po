"The mnemonic of a mythical ASCII control character (End Of User) that "
"would make an ASR-33 Teletype explode on receipt. This construction "
"parodies the numerous obscure delimiter and control characters left in "
"ASCII from the days when it was associated more with wire-service "
"teletypes than computers (e.g., FS, GS, RS, US, EM, SUB, ETX, and esp. "
"EOT). It is worth remembering that ASR-33s were big, noisy mechanical "
"beasts with a lot of clattering parts; the notion that one might explode "
"was nowhere near as ridiculous as it might seem to someone sitting in "
"front of a :ref:`tube` or flatscreen today."
