"[common] An ASCII glyph used to indicate an emotional state in email or "
"news. Although originally intended mostly as jokes, emoticons (or some "
"other explicit humor indication) are virtually required under certain "
"circumstances in high-volume text-only communication forums such as "
"Usenet; the lack of verbal and visual cues can otherwise cause what were "
"intended to be humorous, sarcastic, ironic, or otherwise non-100%-serious"
" comments to be badly misinterpreted (not always even by "
":ref:`newbie`\\s), resulting in arguments and :ref:`flame-war`\\s."

"(These may become more comprehensible if you tilt your head sideways, to "
"the left.) The first two listed are by far the most frequently "
"encountered. Hyphenless forms of them are common on CompuServe, GEnie, "
"and BIX; see also :ref:`bixie`\\. On :ref:`Usenet`\\, smiley is often "
"used as a generic term synonymous with :ref:`emoticon`\\, as well as "
"specifically for the happy-face emoticon."

"The invention of the original smiley and frowney emoticons is generally "
"credited to Scott Fahlman at CMU in 1982. He later wrote: \"I wish I had "
"saved the original post, or at least recorded the date for posterity, but"
" I had no idea that I was starting something that would soon pollute all "
"the world's communication channels.\" In September 2002 the original post"
" `was recovered "

"There is a rival claim by one Kevin McKenzie, who seems to have proposed "
"the smiley on the MsgGroup mailing list, April 12 1979. It seems likely "
"these two inventions were independent. Users of the PLATO educational "
"system `report <http://www.platopeople.com/emoticons.html>`_\\  using "
"emoticons composed from overlaid dot-matrix graphics in the 1970s."

"Note for the :ref:`newbie`\\: Overuse of the smiley is a mark of "
"loserhood! More than one per paragraph is a fairly sure sign that you've "
"gone over the line."
