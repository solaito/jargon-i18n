"Clueful. Plugged-in. One of the cognoscenti. Also used as a general "
"positive adjective. This term is not actually native hacker slang; it is "
"used primarily by crackers and :ref:`warez-d00dz`\\, for which reason "
"hackers use it only with heavy irony. The term used to refer to the folks"
" allowed in to the \"hidden\" or \"privileged\" sections of BBSes in the "
"early 1980s (which, typically, contained pirated software). Frequently, "
"early boards would only let you post, or even see, a certain subset of "
"the sections (or ‘boards’) on a BBS. Those who got to the frequently "
"legendary ‘triple super secret’ boards were elite. Misspellings of this "
"term in warez d00dz style abound; the forms l337 eleet, and 31337 (among "
"others) have been sighted."
