"[from Editing MACroS] The ne plus ultra of hacker editors, a programmable"
" text editor with an entire LISP system inside it. It was originally "
"written by Richard Stallman in :ref:`TECO` under :ref:`ITS` at the MIT AI"
" lab; AI Memo 554 described it as \"an advanced, self-documenting, "
"customizable, extensible real-time display editor\". It has since been "
"reimplemented any number of times, by various hackers, and versions exist"
" that run under most major operating systems. Perhaps the most widely "
"used version, also written by Stallman and now called \" :ref:`GNU` "
"EMACS\" or :ref:`GNUMACS`\\, runs principally under Unix. (Its close "
"relative XEmacs is the second most popular version.) It includes "
"facilities to run compilation subprocesses and send and receive mail or "
"news; many hackers spend up to 80% of their :ref:`tube-time` inside it. "
"Other variants include :ref:`GOSMACS`\\, CCA EMACS, UniPress EMACS, "
"Montgomery EMACS, jove, epsilon, and MicroEMACS. (Though we use the "
"original all-caps spelling here, it is nowadays very commonly ‘Emacs’.) "
"Some EMACS versions running under window managers iconify as an "
"overflowing kitchen sink, perhaps to suggest the one feature the editor "
"does not (yet) include. Indeed, some hackers find EMACS too "
":ref:`heavyweight` and :ref:`baroque` for their taste, and expand the "
"name as ‘Escape Meta Alt Control Shift’ to spoof its heavy reliance on "
"keystrokes decorated with :ref:`bucky-bits`\\. Other spoof expansions "
"include ‘Eight Megabytes And Constantly Swapping’ (from when that was a "
"lot of :ref:`core`\\), ‘Eventually :manpage:`malloc()`\\s All Computer "
"Storage’, and ‘EMACS Makes A Computer Slow’ (see :ref:`recursive-"
"acronym`\\). See also :ref:`vi`\\."
