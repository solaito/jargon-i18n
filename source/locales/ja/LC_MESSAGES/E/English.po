"n\\. obs. The source code for a program, which may be in any language, as"
" opposed to the linkable or executable binary produced from it by a "
"compiler. The idea behind the term is that to a real hacker, a program "
"written in his favorite programming language is at least as readable as "
"English. Usage: mostly by old-time hackers, though recognizable in "
"context. Today the preferred shorthand is simply :ref:`source`\\."

"The official name of the database language used by the old Pick Operating"
" System, actually a sort of crufty, brain-damaged SQL with delusions of "
"grandeur. The name permitted :ref:`marketroid`\\s to say \"Yes, and you "
"can program our computers in English!\" to ignorant :ref:`suit`\\s "
"without quite running afoul of the truth-in-advertising laws."
