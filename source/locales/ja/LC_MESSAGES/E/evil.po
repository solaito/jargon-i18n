"As used by hackers, implies that some system, program, person, or "
"institution is sufficiently maldesigned as to be not worth the bother of "
"dealing with. Unlike the adjectives in the :ref:`cretinous`\\/ "
":ref:`losing`\\/ :ref:`brain-damaged` series, evil does not imply "
"incompetence or bad design, but rather a set of goals or design criteria "
"fatally incompatible with the speaker's. This usage is more an esthetic "
"and engineering judgment than a moral one in the mainstream sense. \"We "
"thought about adding a :ref:`Blue-Glue` interface but decided it was too "
"evil to deal with.\" \" :ref:`TECO` is neat, but it can be pretty evil if"
" you're prone to typos.\" Often pronounced with the first syllable "
"lengthened, as /eeee'vil/. Compare :ref:`evil-and-rude`\\."
