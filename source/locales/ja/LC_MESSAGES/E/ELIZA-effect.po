"[AI community] The tendency of humans to attach associations to terms "
"from prior experience. For example, there is nothing magic about the "
"symbol ``+`` that makes it well-suited to indicate addition; it's just "
"that people associate it with addition. Using ``+`` or ‘plus’ to mean "
"addition in a computer language is taking advantage of the ELIZA effect."

"This term comes from the famous ELIZA program by Joseph Weizenbaum, which"
" simulated a Rogerian psychotherapist by re­phrasing many of the "
"patient's statements as questions and posing them to the patient. It "
"worked by simple pattern recognition and substitution of key words into "
"canned phrases. It was so convincing, however, that there are many "
"anecdotes about people becoming very emotionally caught up in dealing "
"with ELIZA. All this was due to people's tendency to attach to words "
"meanings which the computer never put there. The ELIZA effect is a :ref"
":`Good-Thing` when writing a programming language, but it can blind you "
"to serious shortcomings when analyzing an Artificial Intelligence system."
" Compare :ref:`ad-hockery`\\; see also :ref:`AI-complete`\\. Sources for "
"a clone of the original Eliza are available at "
