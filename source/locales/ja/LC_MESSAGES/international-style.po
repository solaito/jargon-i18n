"Although the Jargon File remains primarily a lexicon of hacker usage in "
"American English, we have made some effort to get input from abroad. "
"Though the hacker-speak of other languages often uses translations of "
"jargon from English (often as transmitted to them by earlier Jargon File "
"versions! ), the local variations are interesting, and knowledge of them "
"may be of some use to travelling hackers."

"There are some references herein to ‘Commonwealth hackish’. These are "
"intended to describe some variations in hacker usage as reported in the "
"English spoken in Great Britain and the Commonwealth (Canada, Australia, "
"India, etc. — though Canada is heavily influenced by American usage). "
"There is also an entry on :ref:`Commonwealth-Hackish` reporting some "
"general phonetic and vocabulary differences from U.S. hackish."

"Hackers in Western Europe and (especially) Scandinavia report that they "
"often use a mixture of English and their native languages for technical "
"conversation. Occasionally they develop idioms in their English usage "
"that are influenced by their native-language styles. Some of these are "
"reported here."

"On the other hand, English often gives rise to grammatical and vocabulary"
" mutations in the native language. For example, Italian hackers often use"
" the nonexistent verbs ‘scrollare’ (to scroll) and ‘deletare’ (to delete)"
" rather than native Italian *scorrere* and *cancellare*\\. Similarly, the"
" English verb ‘to hack’ has been seen conjugated in Swedish. In German, "
"many Unix terms in English are casually declined as if they were German "
"verbs -- thus: mount/mounten/gemountet; grep/grepen/gegrept; "
"fork/forken/geforkt; core dump/core-dumpen, gecoredumpt. And Spanish-"
"speaking hackers use ‘linkear’ (to link), ‘debugear’ (to debug), and "
"‘lockear’ (to lock)."

"European hackers report that this happens partly because the English "
"terms make finer distinctions than are available in their native "
"vocabularies, and partly because deliberate language-crossing makes for "
"amusing wordplay."

"A few notes on hackish usages in Russian have been added where they are "
"parallel with English idioms and thus comprehensible to English-speakers."
