"The original Jargon File was a collection of hacker jargon from technical"
" cultures including the MIT AI Lab, the Stanford AI lab (SAIL), and "
"others of the old ARPANET AI/LISP/PDP-10 communities including Bolt, "
"Beranek and Newman (BBN), Carnegie-Mellon University (CMU), and Worcester"
" Polytechnic Institute (WPI)."

"The Jargon File (hereafter referred to as ‘jargon-1’ or ‘the File’) was "
"begun by Raphael Finkel at Stanford in 1975. From this time until the "
"plug was finally pulled on the SAIL computer in 1991, the File was named "
"AIWORD.RF[UP,DOC] there. Some terms in it date back considerably earlier "
"( :ref:`frob` and some senses of :ref:`moby`\\, for instance, go back to "
"the Tech Model Railroad Club at MIT and are believed to date at least "
"back to the early 1960s). The revisions of jargon-1 were all unnumbered "
"and may be collectively considered ‘Version 1’."

msgid ""
"In 1976, Mark Crispin, having seen an announcement about the File on the "
"SAIL computer, FTPed a copy of the File to MIT. He noticed that it was "
"hardly restricted to ‘AI words’ and so stored the file on his directory "
"as AI:MRC;SAIL JARGON."
msgstr ""

#: ../../revision-history.rst:17
msgid ""
"The file was quickly renamed JARGON > (the ‘>’ caused versioning under "
"ITS) as a flurry of enhancements were made by Mark Crispin and Guy L. "
"Steele Jr. Unfortunately, amidst all this activity, nobody thought of "
"correcting the term ‘jargon’ to ‘slang’ until the compendium had already "
"become widely known as the Jargon File."

"Raphael Finkel dropped out of active participation shortly thereafter and"
" Don Woods became the SAIL contact for the File (which was subsequently "

"The File expanded by fits and starts until about 1983; Richard Stallman "

"In Spring 1981, a hacker named Charles Spurgeon got a large chunk of the "
"File published in Stewart Brand's *CoEvolution Quarterly* (issue 29, "
"pages 26—35) with illustrations by Phil Wadler and Guy Steele (including "
"a couple of the Crunchly cartoons). This appears to have been the File's "
"first paper publication."

"A late version of jargon-1, expanded with commentary for the mass market,"
" was edited by Guy Steele into a book published in 1983 as *The Hacker's "
"Dictionary* (Harper & Row CN 1082, ISBN 0-06-091082-8). The other "
"jargon-1 editors (Raphael Finkel, Don Woods, and Mark Crispin) "
"contributed to this revision, as did Richard M. Stallman and Geoff "
"Goodfellow. This book (now out of print) is hereafter referred to as "
"‘Steele-1983’ and those six as the Steele-1983 coauthors."

"Shortly after the publication of Steele-1983, the File effectively "
"stopped growing and changing. Originally, this was due to a desire to "
"freeze the file temporarily to facilitate the production of Steele-1983, "

"permanent."

"The AI Lab culture had been hit hard in the late 1970s by funding cuts "
"and the resulting administrative decision to use vendor-supported "
"hardware and software instead of homebrew whenever possible. At MIT, most"
" AI work had turned to dedicated LISP Machines. At the same time, the "
"commercialization of AI technology lured some of the AI Lab's best and "
"brightest away to startups along the Route 128 strip in Massachusetts and"
" out West in Silicon Valley. The startups built LISP machines for MIT; "
"the central MIT-AI computer became a :ref:`TWENEX` system rather than a "
"host for the AI hackers' beloved :ref:`ITS`\\."
msgstr ""

#: ../../revision-history.rst:39
msgid ""
"The Stanford AI Lab had effectively ceased to exist by 1980, although the"
" SAIL computer continued as a Computer Science Department resource until "
"1991. Stanford became a major :ref:`TWENEX` site, at one point operating "
"more than a dozen TOPS-20 systems; but by the mid-1980s most of the "
"interesting software work was being done on the emerging BSD Unix "
"standard."

"In April 1983, the PDP-10-centered cultures that had nourished the File "
"were dealt a death-blow by the cancellation of the Jupiter project at "
"Digital Equipment Corporation. The File's compilers, already dispersed, "
"moved on to other things. Steele-1983 was partly a monument to what its "
"authors thought was a dying tradition; no one involved realized at the "
"time just how wide its influence was to be."

"By the mid-1980s the File's content was dated, but the legend that had "
"grown up around it never quite died out. The book, and softcopies "
"obtained off the ARPANET, circulated even in cultures far removed from "
"MIT and Stanford; the content exerted a strong and continuing influence "
"on hacker language and humor. Even as the advent of the microcomputer and"
" other trends fueled a tremendous expansion of hackerdom, the File (and "
"related materials such as the :ref:`Some AI Koans<koans>` in Appendix A) "
"came to be seen as a sort of sacred epic, a hacker-culture Matter of "
"Britain chronicling the heroic exploits of the Knights of the Lab. The "
"pace of change in hackerdom at large accelerated tremendously — but the "
"Jargon File, having passed from living document to icon, remained "
"essentially untouched for seven years."

"jargon-1 (a few obsolete PDP-10-related entries were dropped after "
"careful consultation with the editors of Steele-1983). It merges in about"
" 80% of the Steele-1983 text, omitting some framing material and a very "
"few entries introduced in Steele-1983 that are now also obsolete."

"This new version casts a wider net than the old Jargon File; its aim is "
"to cover not just AI or PDP-10 hacker culture but all the technical "
"computing cultures wherein the true hacker-nature is manifested. More "
"than half of the entries now derive from :ref:`Usenet` and represent "
"jargon now current in the C and Unix communities, but special efforts "
