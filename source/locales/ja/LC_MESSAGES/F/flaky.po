"(var sp. flakey) Subject to frequent :ref:`lossage`\\. This use is of "
"course related to the common slang use of the word to describe a person "
"as eccentric, crazy, or just unreliable. A system that is flaky is "
"working, sort of — enough that you are tempted to try to use it — but "
"fails frequently enough that the odds in favor of finishing what you "
"start are low. Commonwealth hackish prefers :ref:`dodgy` or "
":ref:`wonky`\\."
