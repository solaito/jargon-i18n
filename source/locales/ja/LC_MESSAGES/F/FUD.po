"Defined by Gene Amdahl after he left IBM to found his own company: \"FUD "
"is the fear, uncertainty, and doubt that IBM sales people instill in the "
"minds of potential customers who might be considering [Amdahl] "
"products.\" The idea, of course, was to persuade them to go with safe IBM"
" gear rather than with competitors' equipment. This implicit coercion was"
" traditionally accomplished by promising that Good Things would happen to"
" people who stuck with IBM, but Dark Shadows loomed over the future of "
"competitors' equipment or software. See :ref:`IBM`\\. After 1990 the term"
" FUD was associated increasingly frequently with :ref:`Microsoft`\\, and "
"has become generalized to refer to any kind of disinformation used as a "
"competitive weapon."

"[In 2003, SCO sued IBM in an action which, among other things, alleged "
"SCO's proprietary control of :ref:`Linux`\\. The SCO suit rapidly became "
"infamous for the number and magnitude of falsehoods alleged in SCO's "
"filings. In October 2003, SCO's lawyers filed a `memorandum "
"<http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20031024191141102>`_\\  in "
"which they actually had the temerity to link to the web version of *this "
"entry* in furtherance of their claims. Whilst we appreciate the "
"compliment of being treated as an authority, we can return it only by "
"observing that SCO has become a nest of liars and thieves compared to "
"which IBM at its historic worst looked positively angelic. Any judge or "
"law clerk reading this should surf through to `my collected resources "
"<http://www.catb.org/~esr/sco.html>`_\\  on this topic for the appalling "
"details.â€”ESR]"
