"Old-time hacker David Cargill's theory on the causation of computer "
"glitches. Your typical electric utility draws its line current out of the"
" big generators with a pair of coil taps located near the top of the "
"dynamo. When the normal tap brushes get dirty, they take them off line to"
" clean them up, and use special auxiliary taps on the *bottom* of the "
"coil. Now, this is a problem, because when they do that they get not "
"ordinary or ‘thin’ electrons, but the fat'n'sloppy electrons that are "
"heavier and so settle to the bottom of the generator. These flow down "
"ordinary wires just fine, but when they have to turn a sharp corner (as "
"in an integrated-circuit via), they're apt to get stuck. This is what "
"causes computer glitches. [Fascinating. Obviously, fat electrons must "
"gain mass by :ref:`bogon` absorption —ESR] Compare :ref:`bogon`\\, :ref"
":`magic-smoke`\\."
