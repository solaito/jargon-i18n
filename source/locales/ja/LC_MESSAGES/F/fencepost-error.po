"[common] A problem with the discrete equivalent of a boundary condition, "
"often exhibited in programs by iterative loops. From the following "
"problem: \"If you build a fence 100 feet long with posts 10 feet apart, "
"how many posts do you need?\" (Either 9 or 11 is a better answer than the"
" obvious 10.) For example, suppose you have a long list or array of "
"items, and want to process items ``m`` through ``n``\\; how many items "
"are there? The obvious answer is ``n - m``\\, but that is off by one; the"
" right answer is ``n - m + 1``\\. A program that used the ‘obvious’ "
"formula would have a fencepost error in it. See also :ref:`zeroth` and "
":ref:`off-by-one-error`\\, and note that not all off-by-one errors are "
"fencepost errors. The game of Musical Chairs involves a catastrophic off-"
"by-one error where ``N`` people try to sit in ``N - 1`` chairs, but it's "
"not a fencepost error. Fencepost errors come from counting things rather "
"than the spaces between them, or vice versa, or by neglecting to consider"
" whether one should count one or both ends of a row."

"[rare] An error induced by unexpected regularities in input values, which"
" can (for instance) completely thwart a theoretically efficient binary "
"tree or hash table implementation. (The error here involves the "
"difference between expected and worst case behaviors of an algorithm.)"
