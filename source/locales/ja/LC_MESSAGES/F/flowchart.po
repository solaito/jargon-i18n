"[techspeak] An archaic form of visual control-flow specification "
"employing arrows and speech balloons of various shapes. Hackers never use"
" flowcharts, consider them extremely silly, and associate them with "
":ref:`COBOL` programmers, :ref:`code-grinder`\\s, and other lower forms "
"of life. This attitude follows from the observations that flowcharts (at "
"least from a hacker's point of view) are no easier to read than code, are"
" less precise, and tend to fall out of sync with the code (so that they "
"either obfuscate it rather than explaining it, or require extra "
"maintenance effort that doesn't improve the code)."
