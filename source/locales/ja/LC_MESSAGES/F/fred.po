"The personal name most frequently used as a :ref:`metasyntactic-variable`"
" (see :ref:`foo`\\). Allegedly popular because it's easy for a non-touch-"
"typist to type on a standard QWERTY keyboard. In Great Britain, ‘fred’, "
"‘jim’ and ‘sheila’ are common metasyntactic variables because their "
"uppercase versions were *official* names given to the 3 memory areas that"
" held I/O status registers on the lovingly-remembered BBC Microcomputer! "
"(It is reported that SHEILA was poked the most often.) Unlike :ref:`J"
"--Random-Hacker` or J. Random Loser, the name ‘fred’ has no positive or "
"negative loading (but see :ref:`Dr--Fred-Mbogo`\\). See also "
":ref:`barney`\\."
