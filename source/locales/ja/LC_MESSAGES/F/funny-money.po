"Notional ‘dollar’ units of computing time and/or storage handed to "
"students at the beginning of a computer course; also called play money or"
" purple money (in implicit opposition to real or green money). In New "
"Zealand and Germany the odd usage paper money has been recorded; in "
"Germany, the particularly amusing synonym transfer ruble commemorates the"
" funny money used for trade between COMECON countries back when the "
"Soviet Bloc still existed. When your funny money ran out, your account "
"froze and you needed to go to a professor to get more. Fortunately, the "
"plunging cost of timesharing cycles has made this less common. The "
"amounts allocated were almost invariably too small, even for the non-"
"hackers who wanted to slide by with minimum work. In extreme cases, the "
"practice led to small-scale black markets in bootlegged computer "
"accounts."
