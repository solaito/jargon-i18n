"n\\. The soft electronic ‘bell’ sound of a display terminal (except for a"
" VT-52); a beep (in fact, the microcomputer world seems to prefer "
":ref:`beep`\\)."

"vi\\. To cause the display to make a feep sound. ASR-33s (the original "
"TTYs) do not feep; they have mechanical bells that ring. Alternate forms:"
" :ref:`beep`\\, ‘bleep’, or just about anything suitably onomatopoeic. "
"(Jeff MacNelly, in his comic strip *Shoe*\\, uses the word ‘eep’ for "
"sounds made by computer terminals and video games; this is perhaps the "
"closest written approximation yet.) The term ‘breedle’ was sometimes "
"heard at SAIL, where the terminal bleepers are not particularly soft "
"(they sound more like the musical equivalent of a raspberry or Bronx "
"cheer; for a close approximation, imagine the sound of a Star Trek "
"communicator's beep lasting for five seconds). The ‘feeper’ on a VT-52 "
"has been compared to the sound of a '52 Chevy stripping its gears. See "
"also :ref:`ding`\\."
