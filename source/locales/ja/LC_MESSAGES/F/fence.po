"A sequence of one or more distinguished ( :ref:`out-of-band`\\) "
"characters (or other data items), used to delimit a piece of data "
"intended to be treated as a unit (the computer-science literature calls "
"this a sentinel). The NUL (ASCII 0000000) character that terminates "
"strings in C is a fence. Hex FF is also (though slightly less frequently)"
" used this way. See :ref:`zigamorph`\\."

"An extra data value inserted in an array or other data structure in order"
" to allow some normal test on the array's contents also to function as a "
"termination test. For example, a highly optimized routine for finding a "
"value in an array might artificially place a copy of the value to be "
"searched for after the last slot of the array, thus allowing the main "
"search loop to search for the value without having to check at each pass "
"whether the end of the array had been reached."

"[among users of optimizing compilers] Any technique, usually exploiting "
"knowledge about the compiler, that blocks certain optimizations. Used "
"when explicit mechanisms are not available or are overkill. Typically a "
"hack: \"I call a dummy procedure there to force a flush of the "
"optimizer's register-coloring info\" can be expressed by the shorter "
"\"That's a fence procedure\"."
