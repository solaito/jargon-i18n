"Literature created by :ref:`marketroid`\\s that allegedly contains "
"technical specs but which is in fact as superficial as possible without "
"being totally :ref:`content-free`\\. \"Forget the four-color glossies, "
"give me the tech ref manuals.\" Often applied as an indication of "
"superficiality even when the material is printed on ordinary paper in "
"black and white. Four-color-glossy manuals are *never* useful for solving"
" a problem."
