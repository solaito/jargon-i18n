"[common] An intended property or behavior (as of a program). Whether it "

"A surprising property or behavior; in particular, one that is purposely "
"inconsistent because it works better that way — such an inconsistency is "
"therefore a :ref:`feature` and not a :ref:`bug`\\. This kind of feature "
"is sometimes called a :ref:`miswart`\\; see that entry for a classic "
"example."

#: ../../F/feature.rst:22
msgid ""
"A property or behavior that is gratuitous or unnecessary, though perhaps "
"also impressive or cute. For example, one feature of Common LISP's "
":code:`format` function is the ability to print numbers in two different "
"Roman-numeral formats (see :ref:`bells-whistles-and-gongs`\\)."

"A property or behavior that was put in to help someone else but that "

msgid ""
"[common] A bug that has been documented. To call something a feature "
"sometimes means the author of the program did not consider the particular"
" case, and that the program responded in a way that was unexpected but "
"not strictly incorrect. A standard joke is that a bug can be turned into "
"a :ref:`feature` simply by documenting it (then theoretically no one can "
"complain about it because it's in the manual), or even by simply "
"declaring it to be good. \"That's not a bug, that's a feature!\" is a "
"common catchphrase. See also :ref:`feetch-feetch`\\, :ref:`creeping-"
"featurism`\\, :ref:`wart`\\, :ref:`green-lightning`\\."

"The relationship among bugs, features, misfeatures, warts, and miswarts "

"A: \"Oh. Then it's a misfeature; they should have increased the spacing "
"between rows here.\""
msgstr ""

#: ../../F/feature.rst:46
msgid ""
"B: \"Yes. But if they'd increased spacing in only one section it would "
"have been a wart — they would've had to make nonstandard-length ceiling "
"panels to fit over the displaced seats.\""
msgstr ""

#: ../../F/feature.rst:49
msgid ""
"A: \"A miswart, actually. If they increased spacing throughout they'd "
"lose several rows and a chunk out of the profit margin. So unequal "
"spacing would actually be the Right Thing.\""

msgid ""
"Undocumented feature is a common, allegedly humorous euphemism for a "
":ref:`bug`\\. There's a related joke that is sometimes referred to as the"
" \"one-question geek test\". You say to someone \"I saw a Volkswagen "
"Beetle today with a vanity license plate that read FEATURE\". If he/she "
"laughs, he/she is a :ref:`geek`\\."
