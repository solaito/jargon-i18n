"[common] Non-working due to hardware failure; burnt out. Especially used "
"of hardware brought down by a power glitch (see :ref:`glitch`\\), :ref"
":`drop-outs`\\, a short, or some other electrical event. (Sometimes this "
"literally happens to electronic circuits! In particular, resistors can "
"burn out and transformers can melt down, emitting noxious smoke â€” see "
":ref:`friode`\\, :ref:`SED` and :ref:`LER`\\. However, this term is also "
"used metaphorically.) Compare :ref:`frotzed`\\."
