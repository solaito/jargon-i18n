"‘Flush’ was standard ITS terminology for aborting an output operation; "
"one spoke of the text that would have been printed, but was not, as "
"having been flushed. It is speculated that this term arose from a vivid "
"image of flushing unwanted characters by hosing down the internal output "
"buffer, washing the characters away before they could be printed. The "
"Unix/C usage, on the other hand, was propagated by the "
":manpage:`fflush(3)` call in C's standard I/O library (though it is "
"reported to have been in use among BLISS programmers at :ref:`DEC` and on"
" Honeywell and IBM machines as far back as 1965). Unix/C hackers found "
"the ITS usage confusing, and vice versa."
