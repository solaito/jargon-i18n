"A compendium of accumulated lore, posted periodically to high-volume "
"newsgroups in an attempt to forestall such questions. Some people prefer "

"This lexicon itself serves as a good example of a collection of one kind "
"of lore, although it is far too big for a regular FAQ posting. Examples: "
"\"What is the proper type of NULL?\" and \"What's that funny name for the"
" ``#`` character?\" are both Frequently Asked Questions. Several FAQs "
"refer readers to the Jargon File."
