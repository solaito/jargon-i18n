"As defined by Richard M. Stallman and used by the Free Software movement,"
" this means software that gives users enough freedom to be used by the "
"free software community. Specifically, users must be free to modify the "
"software for their private use, and free to redistribute it either with "
"or without modifications, either commercially or noncommercially, either "
"gratis or charging a distribution fee. Free software has existed since "
"the dawn of computing; Free Software as a movement began in 1984 with the"
" GNU Project."

"RMS observes that the English word \"free\" can refer either to liberty "
"(where it means the same as the Spanish or French \"libre\") or to price "
"(where it means the same as the Spanish \"gratis\" or French "
"\"gratuit\"). RMS and other people associated with the FSF like to "
"explain the word \"free\" in \"free software\" by saying \"Free as in "
"speech, not as in beer.\""

"See also :ref:`open-source`\\. Hard-core proponents of the term \"free "
"software\" sometimes reject this newer term, claiming that the style of "
"argument associated with it ignores or downplays the moral imperative at "
"the heart of free software."
