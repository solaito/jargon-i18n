"The :ref:`PDP-10` successor that was to have been built by the Super "
"Foonly project at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory along "
"with a new operating system. (The name itself came from FOO NLI, an error"
" message emitted by a PDP-10 assembler at SAIL meaning \"FOO is Not a "
"Legal Identifier\". The intention was to leapfrog from the old :ref:`DEC`"
" timesharing system SAIL was then running to a new generation, bypassing "
"TENEX which at that time was the ARPANET standard. ARPA funding for both "
"the Super Foonly and the new operating system was cut in 1974. Most of "
"the design team went to DEC and contributed greatly to the design of the "
"PDP-10 model KL10."

"The name of the company formed by Dave Poole, one of the principal Super "
"Foonly designers, and one of hackerdom's more colorful personalities. "
"Many people remember the parrot which sat on Poole's shoulder and was a "
"regular companion."

"Any of the machines built by Poole's company. The first was the F-1 "
"(a.k.a. Super Foonly), which was the computational engine used to create "
"the graphics in the movie *TRON*\\. The F-1 was the fastest PDP-10 ever "
"built, but only one was ever made. The effort drained Foonly of its "
"financial resources, and the company turned towards building smaller, "
"slower, and much less expensive machines. Unfortunately, these ran not "
"the popular :ref:`TOPS-20` but a TENEX variant called Foonex; this "
"seriously limited their market. Also, the machines shipped were actually "
"wire-wrapped engineering prototypes requiring individual attention from "
"more than usually competent site personnel, and thus had significant "
"reliability problems. Poole's legendary temper and unwillingness to "
"suffer fools gladly did not help matters. By the time DEC's \"Jupiter "
"Project\" followon to the PDP-10 was cancelled in 1983, Foonly's proposal"
" to build another F-1 was eclipsed by the :ref:`Mars`\\, and the company "
"never quite recovered. See the :ref:`Mars` entry for the continuation and"
" moral of this story."
