"Partial corruption of a text file or input stream by some bug or "
"consistent glitch, as opposed to random events like line noise or media "
"failures. Might occur, for example, if one bit of each incoming character"
" on a tty were stuck, so that some characters were correct and others "
"were not. See :ref:`dread-high-bit-disease`\\."

"By extension, accidental display of text in a mode where the output "
"device emits special symbols or mnemonics rather than conventional ASCII."
" This often happens, for example, when using a terminal or comm program "
"on a device like an IBM PC with a special ‘high-half’ character set and "
"with the bit-parity assumption wrong. A hacker sufficiently familiar with"
" ASCII bit patterns might be able to read the display anyway."
