"[Unix] A particular species of :ref:`wabbit` that can be written in one "
"line of C (:code:`main() {for(;;)fork();`\\}) or shell (:code:`$0 & $0 "
"&`\\) on any Unix system, or occasionally created by an egregious coding "
"bug. A fork bomb process ‘explodes’ by recursively spawning copies of "
"itself (using the Unix system call :manpage:`fork(2)`\\). Eventually it "
"eats all the process table entries and effectively wedges the system. "
"Fortunately, fork bombs are relatively easy to spot and kill, so creating"
" one deliberately seldom accomplishes more than to bring the just wrath "
"of the gods down upon the perpetrator. Also called a fork bunny. See also"
" :ref:`logic-bomb`\\."
