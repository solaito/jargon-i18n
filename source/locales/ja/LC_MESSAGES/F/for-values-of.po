"[MIT] A common rhetorical maneuver at MIT is to use any of the canonical "
":ref:`random-numbers` as placeholders for variables. \"The max function "
"takes 42 arguments, for arbitrary values of 42.:\" \"There are 69 ways to"
" leave your lover, for 69 = 50.\" This is especially likely when the "
"speaker has uttered a random number and realizes that it was not "
"recognized as such, but even ‘non-random’ numbers are occasionally used "
"in this fashion. A related joke is that ``π`` equals 3 — for small values"
" of ``π`` and large values of 3."

"Historical note: at MIT this usage has traditionally been traced to the "
"programming language MAD (Michigan Algorithm Decoder), an Algol-58-like "
"language that was the most common choice among mainstream (non-hacker) "
"users at MIT in the mid-60s. It inherited from Algol-58 a control "
"structure FOR VALUES OF X = 3, 7, 99 DO ... that would repeat the "
"indicated instructions for each value in the list (unlike the usual FOR "
"that only works for arithmetic sequences of values). MAD is long extinct,"
" but similar for-constructs still flourish (e.g., in Unix's shell "
"languages)."
