"A group of machines, especially a large group of near-identical machines "
"running load-balancing software, dedicated to a single task. Historically"
" the term server farm, used especially for a group of web servers, seems "
"to have been coined by analogy with earlier :ref:`disk-farm` in the early"
" 1990s; generalization began with render farm for a group of machines "
"dedicated to rendering computer animations (this term appears to have "
"been popularized by publicity about the pioneering \"Linux render farm\" "
"used to produce the movie *Titanic*\\). By 2001 other combinations such "
"as \"compile farm\" and \"compute farm\" were increasingly common, and "
"arguably borderline techspeak. More jargon uses seem likely to arise (and"
" be absorbed into techspeak over time) as new uses are discovered for "
"networked machine clusters. Compare :ref:`link-farm`\\."
