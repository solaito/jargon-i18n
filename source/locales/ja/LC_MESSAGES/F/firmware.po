"Embedded software contained in EPROM or flash memory. It isn't quite "
"hardware, but at least doesn't have to be loaded from a disk like regular"
" software. Hacker usage differs from straight techspeak in that hackers "
"don't normally apply it to stuff that you can't possibly get at, such as "
"the program that runs a pocket calculator. Instead, it implies that the "
"firmware could be changed, even if doing so would mean opening a box and "
"plugging in a new chip. A computer's BIOS is the classic example, "
"although nowadays there is firmware in disk controllers, modems, video "
"cards and even CD-ROM drives."
