"[common] Freely-redistributable software, often written by enthusiasts "
"and distributed by users' groups, or via electronic mail, local bulletin "
"boards, :ref:`Usenet`\\, or other electronic media. As the culture of the"
" Internet has displaced the older BBS world, this term has lost ground to"
" both :ref:`open-source` and :ref:`free-software`\\; it has increasingly "
"tended to be restricted to software distributed in binary rather than "
"source-code form. At one time, freeware was a trademark of Andrew "
"Fluegelman, the author of the well-known MS-DOS comm program PC-TALK III."
" It wasn't enforced after his mysterious disappearance and presumed death"
" in 1984. See :ref:`shareware`\\, :ref:`FRS`\\."
