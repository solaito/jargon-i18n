"[common] A value or parameter that is varied in an ad hoc way to produce "
"the desired result. The terms tolerance and :ref:`slop` are also used, "
"though these usually indicate a one-sided leeway, such as a buffer that "
"is made larger than necessary because one isn't sure exactly how large it"
" needs to be, and it is better to waste a little space than to lose "
"completely for not having enough. A fudge factor, on the other hand, can "
"often be tweaked in more than one direction. A good example is the fuzz "
"typically allowed in floating-point calculations: two numbers being "
"compared for equality must be allowed to differ by a small amount; if "
"that amount is too small, a computation may never terminate, while if it "
"is too large, results will be needlessly inaccurate. Fudge factors are "
"frequently adjusted incorrectly by programmers who don't fully understand"
" their import. See also :ref:`coefficient-of-X`\\."
