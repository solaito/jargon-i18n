"There is (or was) a more specific meaning of this term in the Amiga "
"community. The word fireworks described the effects of a particularly "
"serious crash which prevented the video pointer(s) from getting reset at "
"the start of the vertical blank. This caused the DAC to scroll through "
"the entire contents of CHIP (video or video+CPU) memory. Since each bit "
"plane would scroll separately this was quite a spectacular effect."
