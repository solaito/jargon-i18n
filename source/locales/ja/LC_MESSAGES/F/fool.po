"As used by hackers, specifically describes a person who habitually "
"reasons from obviously or demonstrably incorrect premises and cannot be "
"persuaded by evidence to do otherwise; it is not generally used in its "
"other senses, i.e., to describe a person with a native incapacity to "
"reason correctly, or a clown. Indeed, in hackish experience many fools "
"are capable of reasoning all too effectively in executing their errors. "

"The Algol 68-R compiler used to initialize its storage to the character "
"string \"F00LF00LF00LF00L...\" because as a pointer or as a floating "
"point number it caused a crash, and as an integer or a character string "
"it was very recognizable in a dump. Sadly, one day a very senior "
"professor at Nottingham University wrote a program that called him a "
"fool. He proceeded to demonstrate the correctness of this assertion by "
"lobbying the university (not quite successfully) to forbid the use of "
"Algol on its computers. See also :ref:`DEADBEEF`\\."
