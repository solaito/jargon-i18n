"[very common] Another widely used :ref:`metasyntactic-variable`\\; see "
":ref:`foo` for etymology. Probably originally propagated through "
"DECsystem manuals by Digital Equipment Corporation ( :ref:`DEC`\\) in "
"1960s and early 1970s; confirmed sightings there go back to 1972. Hackers"
" do *not* generally use this to mean :ref:`FUBAR` in either the slang or "
"jargon sense. See also :ref:`Fred-Foobar`\\. In RFC1639, \"FOOBAR\" was "
"made an abbreviation for \"FTP Operation Over Big Address Records\", but "
"this was an obvious :ref:`backronym`\\. It has been plausibly suggested "
"that \"foobar\" spread among early computer engineers partly because of "
"FUBAR and partly because \"foo bar\" parses in electronics techspeak as "
"an inverted foo signal; if a digital signal is active low (so a negative "
"or zero-voltage condition represents a \"1\") then a horizontal bar is "
"commonly placed over the signal label."
