"[IRC] To pull rank on somebody based on the amount of time one has spent "
"on :ref:`IRC`\\. The term derives from the fact that IRC was originally "
"written in Finland in 1987. There may be some influence from the ‘Finn’ "
"character in William Gibson's seminal cyberpunk novel *Count Zero*\\, who"
" at one point says to another (much younger) character \"I have a pair of"
" shoes older than you are, so shut up!\""
