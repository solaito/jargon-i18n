"Sometimes uttered in response to egregious misbehavior, esp. in software,"
" and esp. of misbehaviors which seem unfairly persistent (as though "
"designed in by the imp of the perverse). Often theatrically elaborated: "
"\"Aiighhh! Fuck me with a piledriver and 16 feet of curare-tipped "
"wrought-iron fence and no lubricants!\" The phrase is sometimes heard "
"abbreviated FMH in polite company."

"[This entry is an extreme example of the hackish habit of coining "
"elaborate and evocative terms for lossage. Here we see a quite self-"
"conscious parody of mainstream expletives that has become a running gag "
"in part of the hacker culture; it illustrates the hackish tendency to "
"turn any situation, even one of extreme frustration, into an intellectual"
" game (the point being, in this case, to creatively produce a long-winded"
" description of the most anatomically absurd mental image possible — the "
"short forms implicitly allude to all the ridiculous long forms ever "
"spoken). Scatological language is actually relatively uncommon among "
"hackers, and there was some controversy over whether this entry ought to "
"be included at all. As it reflects a live usage recognizably peculiar to "
"the hacker culture, we feel it is in the hackish spirit of truthfulness "
"and opposition to all forms of censorship to record it here. —ESR & GLS]"
