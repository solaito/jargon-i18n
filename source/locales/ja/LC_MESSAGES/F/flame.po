"places. It has been reported from MIT, Carleton College and RPI (among "

"It is possible that the hackish sense of ‘flame’ is much older than that."
" The poet Chaucer was also what passed for a wizard hacker in his time; "
"he wrote a treatise on the astrolabe, the most advanced computing device "
"of the day. In Chaucer's *Troilus and Cressida*\\, Cressida laments her "
"inability to grasp the proof of a particular mathematical theorem; her "
"uncle Pandarus then observes that it's called \"the fleminge of "
"wrecches.\" This phrase seems to have been intended in context as \"that "
"which puts the wretches to flight\" but was probably just as ambiguous in"
" Middle English as \"the flaming of wretches\" would be today. One "
"suspects that Chaucer would feel right at home on Usenet."
