"In the open-source community, a fork is what occurs when two (or more) "
"versions of a software package's source code are being developed in "
"parallel which once shared a common code base, and these multiple "
"versions of the source code have irreconcilable differences between them."
" This should not be confused with a development branch, which may later "
"be folded back into the original source code base. Nor should it be "
"confused with what happens when a new distribution of Linux or some other"
" distribution is created, because that largely assembles pieces than can "
"and will be used in other distributions without conflict."

"Forking is uncommon; in fact, it is so uncommon that individual instances"
" loom large in hacker folklore. Notable in this class were the "
"Emacs/XEmacs fork, the GCC/EGCS fork (later healed by a merger) and the "
"forks among the FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD operating systems."
