"A mostly-working computer thrown together from the spare parts of several"
" machines out of which the :ref:`magic-smoke` had been let. Most shops "
"have a closet full of nonworking machines. When a new machine is needed "
"immediately (for testing, for example) and there is no time (or budget) "
"to requisition a new box, someone (often an intern) is tasked with "
"building a Frankenputer."

"Also used in referring to a machine that once was a name-brand computer, "

"class machine inexplicably living in a case marked \"Gateway 486/66\")."
