"Also widely used outside MIT to indicate that additional information will"
" be available at some future time, *without* the implication of anything "
"particularly ordinary about the referenced event. For example, \"The mail"
" file server died this morning; we found garbage all over the root "
"directory. Film at 11.\" would indicate that a major failure had occurred"
" but that the people working on it have no additional information about "
"it as yet; use of the phrase in this way suggests gently that the problem"
" is liable to be fixed more quickly if the people doing the fixing can "
"spend time doing the fixing rather than responding to questions, the "
"answers to which will appear on the normal \"11:00 news\", if people will"
" just be patient."
