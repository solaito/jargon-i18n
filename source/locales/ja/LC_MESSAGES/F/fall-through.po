"To exit a loop by exhaustion, i.e., by having fulfilled its exit "
"condition rather than via a break or exception condition that exits from "
"the middle of it. This usage appears to be *really* old, dating from the "
"1940s and 1950s."

"In C, ‘fall-through’ occurs when the flow of execution in a switch "
"statement reaches a :code:`case` label other than by jumping there from "
"the switch header, passing a point where one would normally expect to "
"find a :code:`break`\\. A trivial example:"

"The effect of the above code is to :manpage:`do_green()` when color is "
":code:`GREEN`\\, :manpage:`do_red()` when color is :code:`RED`\\, "
":manpage:`do_blue()` on any other color other than :code:`PINK`\\, and "
"(and this is the important part) :manpage:`do_pink()` *and then* "
":manpage:`do_red()` when color is :code:`PINK`\\. Fall-through is :ref"
":`considered-harmful` by some, though there are contexts (such as the "
"coding of state machines) in which it is natural; it is generally "
"considered good practice to include a comment highlighting the fall-"
"through where one would normally expect a break. See also :ref:`Duffs-"
"device`\\."
