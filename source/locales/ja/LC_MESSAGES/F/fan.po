"Without qualification, indicates a fan of science fiction, especially one"
" who goes to :ref:`con_`\\s and tends to hang out with other fans. Many "
"hackers are fans, so this term has been imported from fannish slang; "
"however, unlike much fannish slang it is recognized by most non-fannish "
"hackers. Among SF fans the plural is correctly fen, but this usage is not"
" automatic to hackers. \"Laura reads the stuff occasionally but isn't "
"really a fan.\""
