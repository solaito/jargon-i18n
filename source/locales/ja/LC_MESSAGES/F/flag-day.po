"which is costly to make and costly to reverse. \"Can we install that "
"without causing a flag day for all users?\" This term has nothing to do "
"with the use of the word :ref:`flag` to mean a variable that has two "
"values. It came into use when a change was made to the definition of the "
"ASCII character set during the development of :ref:`Multics`\\. The "
"change was scheduled for Flag Day (a U.S. holiday), June 14, 1966."

"time); this moved code points for braces, vertical bar, and circumflex. "
"See also :ref:`backward-combatability`\\. The :ref:`Great-Renaming` was a"
" flag day."
