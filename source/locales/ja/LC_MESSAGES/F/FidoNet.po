"A worldwide hobbyist network of personal computers which exchanges mail, "
"discussion groups, and files. Founded in 1984 and originally consisting "
"only of IBM PCs and compatibles, FidoNet now includes such diverse "
"machines as Apple ][s, Ataris, Amigas, and Unix systems. For years "
"FidoNet actually grew faster than Usenet, but the advent of cheap "
"Internet access probably means its days are numbered. FidoNet's site "
"count has dropped from 38K nodes in 1996 through 15K nodes in 2001 to 10K"
" nodes in late 2003, and most of those are probably single-user machines "
"rather than the thriving BBSes of yore."
