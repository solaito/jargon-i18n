"the classic anthology *A Stress Analysis Of A Strapless Evening Gown: And"

"The label ‘Finagle's Law’ was popularized by SF author Larry Niven in "
"several stories depicting a frontier culture of asteroid miners; this "
"‘Belter’ culture professed a religion and/or running joke involving the "
"worship of the dread god Finagle and his mad prophet Murphy. Some "
"technical and scientific cultures (e.g., paleontologists) know it under "
"the name Sod's Law; this usage may be more common in Great Britain. One "
"variant favored among hackers is \"The perversity of the Universe tends "
"towards a maximum\"; Niven specifically referred to this as O'Toole's "
"Corollary of Finagle's Law. See also :ref:`Hanlons-Razor`\\."
