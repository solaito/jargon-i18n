"In software, a misfeature that becomes understandable only in historical "
"context, as a remnant of times past retained so as not to break "
"compatibility. Example: the retention of octal as default base for string"
" escapes in :ref:`C`\\, in spite of the better match of hexadecimal to "
"ASCII and modern byte-addressable architectures. See :ref:`dusty-deck`\\."

"More restrictively, a feature with past but no present utility. Example: "
"the force-all-caps (LCASE) bits in the V7 and :ref:`BSD` Unix tty driver,"
" designed for use with monocase terminals. (In a perversion of the usual "
"backward-compatibility goal, this functionality has actually been "
"expanded and renamed in some later USG Unix releases as the IUCLC and "
"OLCUC bits.)"
