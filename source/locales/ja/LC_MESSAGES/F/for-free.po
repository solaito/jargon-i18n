"[common] Said of a capability of a programming language or hardware that "
"is available by its design without needing cleverness to implement: \"In "
"APL, we get the matrix operations for free.\" \"And owing to the way "
"revisions are stored in this system, you get revision trees for free.\" "
"The term usually refers to a serendipitous feature of doing things a "
"certain way (compare :ref:`big-win`\\), but it may refer to an "
"intentional but secondary feature."
