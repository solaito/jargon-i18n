"The code you put in a system (say, a telephone switch) to make sure that "
"the users can't do any damage. Since users always want to be able to do "
"everything but never want to suffer for any mistakes, the construction of"
" a firewall is a question not only of defensive coding but also of "
"interface presentation, so that users don't even get curious about those "
"corners of a system where they can burn themselves."

" did quite as much damage."
