"[common after 1997, esp. in the Linux community] An open-source software "
"project is said to have forked or be forked when the project group "
"fissions into two or more parts pursuing separate lines of development "
"(or, less commonly, when a third party unconnected to the project group "
"begins its own line of development). Forking is considered a :ref:`Bad-"
"Thing` â€” not merely because it implies a lot of wasted effort in the "
"future, but because forks tend to be accompanied by a great deal of "
"strife and acrimony between the successor groups over issues of "
"legitimacy, succession, and design direction. There is serious social "
"pressure against forking. As a result, major forks (such as the Gnu-"
"Emacs/XEmacs split, the fissionings of the 386BSD group into three "
"daughter projects, and the short-lived GCC/EGCS split) are rare enough "
"that they are remembered individually in hacker folklore."
