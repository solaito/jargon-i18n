"To lock an evolving software distribution or document against changes so "
"it can be released with some hope of stability. Carries the strong "
"implication that the item in question will ‘unfreeze’ at some future "
"date. \"OK, fix that bug and we'll freeze for release.\" There are more "
"specific constructions on this term. A feature freeze, for example, locks"
" out modifications intended to introduce new features but still allows "
"bugfixes and completion of existing features; a code freeze connotes no "
"more changes at all. At Sun Microsystems and elsewhere, one may also hear"
" references to code slush — that is, an almost-but-not-quite frozen "
"state."
