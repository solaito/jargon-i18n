"[from SF fandom, where a typo for ‘folk’ was adopted as a new word] "
"Originally, a popular or folk song with lyrics revised or completely new "
"lyrics and/or music, intended for humorous effect when read, and/or to be"
" sung late at night at SF conventions. More recently (especially since "
"the late 1980s), filk has come to include a great deal of originally-"
"composed music on SFnal or fantasy themes and a range of moods wider than"
" simple parody or humor. Worthy of mention here because there is a "
"flourishing subgenre of filks called computer filks, written by hackers "
"and often containing rather sophisticated technical humor. See :ref"
":`double-bucky` for an example. Compare :ref:`grilf`\\, :ref:`hing`\\, "
":ref:`pr0n`\\, and :ref:`newsfroup`\\."
