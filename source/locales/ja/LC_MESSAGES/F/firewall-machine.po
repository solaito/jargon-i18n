"A dedicated gateway machine with special security precautions on it, used"
" to service outside network connections and dial-in lines. The idea is to"
" protect a cluster of more loosely administered machines hidden behind it"
" from :ref:`cracker`\\s. The typical firewall is an inexpensive micro-"
"based Unix box kept clean of critical data, with a bunch of modems and "
"public network ports on it but just one carefully watched connection back"
" to the rest of the cluster. The special precautions may include threat "
"monitoring, callback, and even a complete :ref:`iron-box` keyable to "
"particular incoming IDs or activity patterns. Syn. :ref:`flytrap`\\, :ref"
":`Venus-flytrap`\\. See also :ref:`wild-side`\\."
