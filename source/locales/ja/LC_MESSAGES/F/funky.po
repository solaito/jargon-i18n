"Said of something that functions, but in a slightly strange, klugey way. "
"It does the job and would be difficult to change, so its obvious non-"
"optimality is left alone. Often used to describe interfaces. The more "
"bugs something has that nobody has bothered to fix because workarounds "
"are easier, the funkier it is. :ref:`TECO` and UUCP are funky. The Intel "
"i860's exception handling is extraordinarily funky. Most standards "
"acquire funkiness as they age. \"The new mailer is installed, but is "
"still somewhat funky; if it bounces your mail for no reason, try "
"resubmitting it.\" \"This UART is pretty funky. The data ready line is "
"active-high in interrupt mode and active-low in DMA mode.\""
