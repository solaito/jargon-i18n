"[obs.] Abbreviation for \"Freely Redistributable Software\" which entered"
" general use on the Internet in 1995 after years of low-level confusion "
"over what exactly to call software written to be passed around and shared"
" (contending terms including :ref:`freeware`\\, :ref:`shareware`\\, and "
"sourceware were never universally felt to be satisfactory for various "
"subtle reasons). The first formal conference on freely redistributable "
"software was held in Cambridge, Massachussetts, in February 1996 "
"(sponsored by the Free Software Foundation). The conference organizers "
"used the FRS abbreviation heavily in its calls for papers and other "
"literature during 1995. The term was in steady though not common use "
"until 1998 and the invention of :ref:`open-source`\\, after which it "
"became swiftly obsolete."
