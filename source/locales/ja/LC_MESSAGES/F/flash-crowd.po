"Larry Niven's 1973 SF short story *Flash Crowd* predicted that one "
"consequence of cheap teleportation would be huge crowds materializing "
"almost instantly at the sites of interesting news stories. Twenty years "
"later the term passed into common use on the Internet to describe "
"exponential spikes in website or server usage when one passes a certain "
"threshold of popular interest (what this does to the server may also be "
"called :ref:`slashdot-effect`\\). It has been pointed out that the effect"
" was anticipated years earlier in Alfred Bester's 1956 *The Stars My "
