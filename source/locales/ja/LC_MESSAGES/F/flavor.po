"The attribute that causes something to be :ref:`flavorful`\\. Usually "
"used in the phrase \"yields additional flavor\". \"This convention yields"
" additional flavor by allowing one to print text either right-side-up or "
"upside-down.\" See :ref:`vanilla`\\. This usage was certainly reinforced "
"by the terminology of quantum chromodynamics, in which quarks (the "
"constituents of, e.g., protons) come in six flavors (up, down, strange, "
"charm, top, bottom) and three colors (red, blue, green) â€” however, "
"hackish use of flavor at MIT predated QCD."

"Flavors system. Though the Flavors design has been superseded (notably by"
" the Common LISP CLOS facility), the term flavor is still used as a "
"general synonym for class by some LISP hackers."
