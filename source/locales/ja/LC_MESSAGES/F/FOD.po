"[Abbreviation for ‘Finger of Death’, originally a spell-name from fantasy"
" gaming] To terminate with extreme prejudice and with no regard for other"
" people. From :ref:`MUD`\\s where the wizard command ‘FOD <player>’ "
"results in the immediate and total death of <player>, usually as "
"punishment for obnoxious behavior. This usage migrated to other "
"circumstances, such as \"I'm going to fod the process that is burning all"
" the cycles.\""

"In aviation, FOD means Foreign Object Damage, e.g., what happens when a "
"jet engine sucks up a rock on the runway or a bird in flight. Finger of "
"Death is a distressingly apt description of what this generally does to "
"the engine."
