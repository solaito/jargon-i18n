"[TMRC] An unspecified physical object, a widget. Also refers to "
"electronic black boxes. This rare form is usually abbreviated to frotz, "
"or more commonly to :ref:`frob`\\. Also used are frobnule "
"(/frob´n[y]ool/) and frobule (/frob´yool/). Starting perhaps in 1979, "
"frobozz /fr\\@-boz´/ (plural: frobbotzim /fr\\@-bot´zm/) has also become "
"very popular, largely through its exposure as a name via :ref:`Zork`\\. "
"These variants can also be applied to nonphysical objects, such as data "
"structures. For related amusement, see the `Encyclopedia Frobozzica "
"<http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node=Encyclopedia%20Frobozzica"

"Pete Samson, compiler of the original :ref:`TMRC` lexicon, adds, \"Under "
"the TMRC [railroad] layout were many storage boxes, managed (in 1958) by "
"David R. Sawyer. Several had fanciful designations written on them, such "
"as ‘Frobnitz Coil Oil’. Perhaps DRS intended Frobnitz to be a proper "
"name, but the name was quickly taken for the thing\". This was almost "
"certainly the origin of the term."
