"posting (as opposed to a :ref:`reply`\\, which goes by email rather than "
"being broadcast). Followups include the ID of the :ref:`parent-message` "
"in their headers; smart news-readers can use this information to present "
"Usenet news in ‘conversation’ sequence rather than order-of-arrival. See "
