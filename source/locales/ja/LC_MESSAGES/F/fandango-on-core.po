"[Unix/C hackers, from the Iberian dance] In C, a wild pointer that runs "
"out of bounds, causing a :ref:`core-dump`\\, or corrupts the "
":manpage:`malloc(3)` :ref:`arena` in such a way as to cause mysterious "
"failures later on, is sometimes said to have ‘done a fandango on core’. "
"On low-end personal machines without an MMU (or Windows boxes, which have"
" an MMU but use it incompetently), this can corrupt the OS itself, "
"causing massive lossage. Other frenetic dances, such as the cha-cha or "
"the watusi, may be substituted. See :ref:`aliasing-bug`\\, :ref"
":`precedence-lossage`\\, :ref:`smash-the-stack`\\, :ref:`memory-leak`\\, "
":ref:`memory-smash`\\, :ref:`overrun-screw`\\, :ref:`core`\\."
