"Describes a program with a limited interface, deliberately limited "
"capabilities, non-orthogonality, inability to compose primitives, or any "
"other limitation designed to not ‘confuse’ a naive user. This places an "
"upper bound on how far that user can go before the program begins to get "
"in the way of the task instead of helping accomplish it. Used in "
"reference to Macintosh software which doesn't provide obvious "
"capabilities because it is thought that the poor lusers might not be able"
" to handle them. Becomes ‘the rest of *them*\\’ when used in third-party "
"reference; thus, \"Yes, it is an attractive program, but it's designed "
"for The Rest Of Them\" means a program that superficially looks neat but "
"has no depth beyond the surface flash. See also :ref:`WIMP-"
"environment`\\, :ref:`Macintrash`\\, :ref:`point-and-drool-interface`\\, "
":ref:`user-friendly`\\."
