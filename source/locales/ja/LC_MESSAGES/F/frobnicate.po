"[Poss. derived from :ref:`frobnitz`\\, and usually abbreviated to "
":ref:`frob`\\, but frobnicate is recognized as the official full form. :]"
" To manipulate or adjust, to tweak. One frequently frobs bits or other "
"2-state devices. Thus: \"Please frob the light switch\" (that is, flip "
"it), but also \"Stop frobbing that clasp; you'll break it\". One also "
"sees the construction to frob a frob. See :ref:`tweak` and "
":ref:`twiddle`\\."

"Usage: frob, twiddle, and tweak sometimes connote points along a "
"continuum. ‘Frob’ connotes aimless manipulation; twiddle connotes gross "
"manipulation, often a coarse search for a proper setting; tweak connotes "
"fine-tuning. If someone is turning a knob on an oscilloscope, then if "
"he's carefully adjusting it, he is probably tweaking it; if he is just "
"turning it but looking at the screen, he is probably twiddling it; but if"
" he's just doing it because turning a knob is fun, he's frobbing it. The "
"variant frobnosticate has been recently reported."
