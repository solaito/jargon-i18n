"[obs.] To unload a DECtape (so it goes flap, flap, flap...). Old-time "
"hackers at MIT tell of the days when the disk was device 0 and DEC "
"microtapes were 1, 2,... and attempting to flap device 0 would instead "
"start a motor banging inside a cabinet near the disk."

"By extension, to unload any magnetic tape. Modern cartridge tapes no "
"longer actually flap, but the usage has remained. (The term could well be"
" re-applied to DEC's TK50 cartridge tape drive, a spectacularly "
"misengineered contraption which makes a loud flapping sound, almost like "
"an old reel-type lawnmower, in one of its many tape-eating failure "
"modes.)"
