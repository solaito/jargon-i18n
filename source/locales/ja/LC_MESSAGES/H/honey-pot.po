"A box designed to attract :ref:`cracker`\\s so that they can be observed "
"in action. It is usually well isolated from the rest of the network, but "
"has extensive logging (usually network layer, on a different machine). "
"Different from an :ref:`iron-box` in that its purpose is to attract, not "
"merely observe. Sometimes, it is also a defensive network security tactic"
" â€” you set up an easy-to-crack box so that your real servers don't get "
"messed with. The concept was presented in Cheswick & Bellovin's book "
"*Firewalls and Internet Security*\\."
