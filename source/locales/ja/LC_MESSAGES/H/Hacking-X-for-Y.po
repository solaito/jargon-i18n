"[ITS] Ritual phrasing of part of the information which ITS made publicly "
"available about each user. This information (the INQUIR record) was a "
"sort of form in which the user could fill out various fields. On display,"
" two of these fields were always combined into a project description of "
"the form \"Hacking X for Y\" (e.g., \"Hacking perceptrons for Minsky\"). "
"This form of description became traditional and has since been carried "
"over to other systems with more general facilities for self-advertisement"
" (such as Unix :ref:`plan-file`\\s)."
