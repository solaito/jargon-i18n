"(also hysterical raisins) A variant on the stock phrase \"for historical "
"reasons\", indicating specifically that something must be done in some "
"stupid way for backwards compatibility, and moreover that the feature it "
"must be compatible with was the result of a bad design in the first "
"place. \"All IBM PC video adapters have to support MDA text mode for "
"hysterical reasons.\" Compare :ref:`bug-for-bug-compatible`\\."
