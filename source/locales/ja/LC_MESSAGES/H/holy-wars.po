"Great holy wars of the past have included :ref:`ITS` vs.: :ref:`Unix`\\, "
":ref:`Unix` vs.: :ref:`VMS`\\, :ref:`BSD` Unix vs.: System V, :ref:`C` "
"vs.: :ref:`Pascal`\\, :ref:`C` vs.: FORTRAN, etc. In the year 2003, "
"popular favorites of the day are KDE vs, GNOME, vim vs. elvis, Linux vs. "
"[Free\\|Net\\|Open]BSD. Hardy perennials include :ref:`EMACS` vs.: "
":ref:`vi`\\, my personal computer vs.: everyone else's personal computer,"

"technical disputes is that in a holy war most of the participants spend "
"their time trying to pass off personal value choices and cultural "
"attachments as objective technical evaluations. This happens precisely "
"because in a true holy war, the actual substantive differences between "
"the sides are relatively minor. See also :ref:`theology`\\."
