"Often adduced as the reason or motivation for expending effort toward a "
"seemingly useless goal, the point being that the accomplished goal is a "
"hack. For example, MacLISP had features for reading and printing Roman "
"numerals, which were installed purely for hack value. See :ref:`display-"
"hack` for one method of computing hack value, but this cannot really be "
"explained, only experienced. As Louis Armstrong once said when asked to "
"explain jazz: \"Man, if you gotta ask you'll never know.\" (Feminists "
"please note Fats Waller's explanation of rhythm: \"Lady, if you got to "
"ask, you ain't got it.\")"
