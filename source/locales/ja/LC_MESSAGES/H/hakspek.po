"A shorthand method of spelling found on many British academic bulletin "
"boards and :ref:`talker-system`\\s. Syllables and whole words in a "
"sentence are replaced by single ASCII characters the names of which are "
"phonetically similar or equivalent, while multiple letters are usually "
"dropped. Hence, ‘for’ becomes ‘4’; ‘two’, ‘too’, and ‘to’ become ‘2’; "
"‘ck’ becomes ‘k’. \"Before I see you tomorrow\" becomes \"b4 i c u "
"2moro\". First appeared in London about 1986, and was probably caused by "
"the slowness of available talker systems, which operated on archaic "
"machines with outdated operating systems and no standard methods of "
"communication."

"Hakspek almost disappeared after the great bandwidth explosion of the "
"early 1990s, as fast Internet links wiped out the old-style talker "
"systems. However, it has enjoyed a revival in another medium — the Short "
"Message Service (SMS) associated with GSM cellphones. SMS sends are "
"limited to a maximum of 160 characters, and typing on a cellphone keypad "
"is difficult and slow anyway. There are now even published paper "
"dictionaries for SMS users to help them do hakspek-to-English and vice-"
"versa."
