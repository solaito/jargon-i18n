"[from SF fandom, orig. as mutation of HHOK, ‘Ha Ha Only Kidding’] A "
"phrase (often seen abbreviated as HHOS) that aptly captures the flavor of"
" much hacker discourse. Applied especially to parodies, absurdities, and "
"ironic jokes that are both intended and perceived to contain a possibly "
"disquieting amount of truth, or truths that are constructed on in-joke "
"and self-parody. This lexicon contains many examples of ha-ha-only-"
"serious in both form and content. Indeed, the entirety of hacker culture "
"is often perceived as ha-ha-only-serious by hackers themselves; to take "
"it either too lightly or too seriously marks a person as an outsider, a "
":ref:`wannabee`\\, or in :ref:`larval-stage`\\. For further enlightenment"
" on this subject, consult any Zen master. See also :ref:`hacker-humor`\\,"
" and :ref:`koan`\\."
