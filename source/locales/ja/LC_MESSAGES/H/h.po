"[from SF fandom] A method of ‘marking’ common words, i.e., calling "
"attention to the fact that they are being used in a nonstandard, ironic, "
"or humorous way. Originated in the fannish catchphrase \"Bheer is the One"
" True Ghod!\" from decades ago. H-infix marking of ‘Ghod’ and other words"
" spread into the 1960s counterculture via underground comix, and into "
"early hackerdom either from the counterculture or from SF fandom (the "
"three overlapped heavily at the time). More recently, the h infix has "
"become an expected feature of benchmark names (Dhrystone, Rhealstone, "
"etc. ); this is probably patterning on the original Whetstone (the name "
"of a laboratory) but influenced by the fannish/counterculture h infix."
