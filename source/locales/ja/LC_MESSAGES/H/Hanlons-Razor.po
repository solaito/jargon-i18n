"A corollary of :ref:`Finagles-Law`\\, similar to Occam's Razor, that "
"reads \"Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained "
"by stupidity.\" Quoted here because it seems to be a particular favorite "
"of hackers, often showing up in :ref:`sig-block`\\s, :ref:`fortune-"
"cookie` files and the login banners of BBS systems and commercial "
"networks. This probably reflects the hacker's daily experience of "
"environments created by well-intentioned but short-sighted people. "
"Compare :ref:`Sturgeons-Law`\\, :ref:`Ninety-Ninety-Rule`\\."

"At `http://www.statusq.org/2001/11/26.html "
"<http://www.statusq.org/2001/11/26.html>`_\\  it is claimed that Hanlon's"
" Razor was coined by one Robert J. Hanlon of Scranton, PA. However, a "
"curiously similar remark (\"You have attributed conditions to villainy "
"that simply result from stupidity.\") appears in *Logic of Empire*\\, a "
"classic 1941 SF story by Robert A. Heinlein, who calls the error it "
"indicates the ‘devil theory’ of sociology. Similar epigrams have been "
"attributed to William James and (on dubious evidence) Napoleon Bonaparte."
