"Occasional West Coast equivalent of :ref:`hello-world`\\; seems to have "
"originated at SAIL, later associated with the game :ref:`Zork` (which "
"also included \"hello, aviator\" and \"hello, implementor\"). Originally "
"from the traditional hooker's greeting to a swabbie fresh off the boat, "
"of course. The standard response is \"Nothing happens here. \"; of all "
"the Zork/Dungeon games, only in Infocom's Zork 3 is \"Hello, Sailor\" "
"actually useful (excluding the unique situation where _knowing_ this fact"
" is important in Dungeon...)."
