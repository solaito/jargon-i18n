"[common] High-overhead; :ref:`baroque`\\; code-intensive; featureful, but"
" costly. Esp. used of communication protocols, language designs, and any "
"sort of implementation in which maximum generality and/or ease of "
"implementation has been pushed at the expense of mundane considerations "
"such as speed, memory utilization, and startup time. :ref:`EMACS` is a "
"heavyweight editor; :ref:`X` is an *extremely* heavyweight window system."
" This term isn't pejorative, but one hacker's heavyweight is another's "
":ref:`elephantine` and a third's :ref:`monstrosity`\\. Oppose "
"lightweight. Usage: now borders on techspeak, especially in the compound "
"heavyweight process."
