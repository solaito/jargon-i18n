"[primarily used by C/Unix programmers, but spreading] It is received "
"wisdom that in most programs, less than 10% of the code eats 90% of the "
"execution time; if one were to graph instruction visits versus code "
"addresses, one would typically see a few huge spikes amidst a lot of low-"
"level noise. Such spikes are called hot spots and are good candidates for"
" heavy optimization or :ref:`hand-hacking`\\. The term is especially used"
" of tight loops and recursions in the code's central algorithm, as "
"opposed to (say) initial set-up costs or large but infrequent I/O "
"operations. See :ref:`tune`\\, :ref:`hand-hacking`\\."

"A screen region that is sensitive to mouse gestures, which trigger some "
"action. World Wide Web pages now provide the :ref:`canonical` examples; "
"WWW browsers present hypertext links as hot spots which, when clicked on,"
" point the browser at another document (these are specifically called "
":ref:`hotlink`\\s)."
