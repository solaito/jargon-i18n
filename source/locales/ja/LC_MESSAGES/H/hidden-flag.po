"[scientific computation] An extra option added to a routine without "
"changing the calling sequence. For example, instead of adding an explicit"
" input variable to instruct a routine to give extra diagnostic output, "
"the programmer might just add a test for some otherwise meaningless "
"feature of the existing inputs, such as a negative mass. The use of "
"hidden flags can make a program very hard to debug and understand, but is"
" all too common wherever programs are hacked on in a hurry."
