"If someone starts a sentence with \"Clearly...\" or \"Obviously...\" or "
"\"It is self-evident that...\", it is a good bet he is about to handwave "
"(alternatively, use of these constructions in a sarcastic tone before a "
"paraphrase of someone else's argument suggests that it is a handwave). "
"The theory behind this term is that if you wave your hands at the right "
"moment, the listener may be sufficiently distracted to not notice that "
"what you have said is :ref:`bogus`\\. Failing that, if a listener does "
"object, you might try to dismiss the objection with a wave of your hand."

"The use of this word is often accompanied by gestures: both hands up, "
"palms forward, swinging the hands in a vertical plane pivoting at the "
"elbows and/or shoulders (depending on the magnitude of the handwave); "
"alternatively, holding the forearms in one position while rotating the "
"hands at the wrist to make them flutter. In context, the gestures alone "
"can suffice as a remark; if a speaker makes an outrageously unsupported "
"assumption, you might simply wave your hands in this way, as an "
"accusation, far more eloquent than words could express, that his logic is"
" faulty."
