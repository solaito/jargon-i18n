"Any of the minimal programs that emit this message (a representative "
"sample in various languages can be found at "
"`http://www.latech.edu/~acm/helloworld/ "
"<http://www.latech.edu/~acm/helloworld/>`_). Traditionally, the first "
"program a C coder is supposed to write in a new environment is one that "
"just prints \"hello, world\" to standard output (and indeed it is the "
"first example program in :ref:`K-ampersand-R`\\). Environments that "
"generate an unreasonably large executable for this trivial test or which "
"require a :ref:`hairy` compiler-linker invocation to generate it are "
"considered to :ref:`lose` (see :ref:`X`\\)."
