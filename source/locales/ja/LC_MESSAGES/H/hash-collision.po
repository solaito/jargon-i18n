"[from the techspeak] (var. : hash clash) When used of people, signifies a"
" confusion in associative memory or imagination, especially a persistent "
"one (see :ref:`thinko`\\). True story: One of us [ESR] was once on the "
"phone with a friend about to move out to Berkeley. When asked what he "
"expected Berkeley to be like, the friend replied: \"Well, I have this "
"mental picture of naked women throwing Molotov cocktails, but I think "
"that's just a collision in my hash tables.\" Compare :ref:`hash-"
