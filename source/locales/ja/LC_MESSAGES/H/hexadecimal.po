"Base 16. Coined in the early 1950s to replace earlier sexadecimal, which "
"was too racy and amusing for stuffy IBM, and later adopted by the rest of"
" the industry."

"Actually, neither term is etymologically pure. If we take binary to be "
"paradigmatic, the most etymologically correct term for base 10, for "
"example, is ‘denary’, which comes from ‘deni’ (ten at a time, ten each), "
"a Latin distributive number; the corresponding term for base-16 would be "
"something like ‘sendenary’. \"Decimal\" comes from the combining root of "
"decem, Latin for 10. If wish to create a truly analogous word for base "
"16, we should start with sedecim, Latin for 16. Ergo, sedecimal is the "
"word that would have been created by a Latin scholar. The ‘sexa-’ prefix "
"is Latin but incorrect in this context, and ‘hexa-’ is Greek. The word "
"octal is similarly incorrect; a correct form would be ‘octaval’ (to go "
"with decimal), or ‘octonary’ (to go with binary). If anyone ever "
"implements a base-3 computer, computer scientists will be faced with the "
"unprecedented dilemma of a choice between two *correct* forms; both "
"ternary and trinary have a claim to this throne."
