"A notional receptacle, a set of which might be used to apportion data "
"items for sorting or lookup purposes. When you look up a name in the "
"phone book (for example), you typically hash it by extracting its first "
"letter; the hash buckets are the alphabetically ordered letter sections. "
"This term is used as techspeak with respect to code that uses actual hash"
" functions; in jargon, it is used for human associative memory as well. "
"Thus, two things ‘in the same hash bucket’ are more difficult to "
"discriminate, and may be confused. \"If you hash English words only by "
"length, you get too many common grammar words in the first couple of hash"
" buckets.\" Compare :ref:`hash-collision`\\."
