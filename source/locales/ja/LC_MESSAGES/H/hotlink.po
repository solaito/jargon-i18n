"A :ref:`hot-spot` on a World Wide Web page; an area, which, when clicked "
"or selected, chases a URL. Also spelled ‘hot link’. Use of this term "
"focuses on the link's role as an immediate part of your display, as "
"opposed to the timeless sense of logical connection suggested by :ref"
":`web-pointer`\\. Your screen shows hotlinks but your document has web "
"pointers, not (in normal usage) the other way around."
