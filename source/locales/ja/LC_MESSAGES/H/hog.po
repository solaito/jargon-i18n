"Favored term to describe programs or hardware that seem to eat far more "
"than their share of a system's resources, esp. those which noticeably "
"degrade interactive response.*Not* used of programs that are simply "
"extremely large or complex or that are merely painfully slow themselves. "
"More often than not encountered in qualified forms, e.g., memory hog, "
"core hog, hog the processor, hog the disk. \"A controller that never "
"gives up the I/O bus gets killed after the bus-hog timer expires.\""

"Also said of *people* who use more than their fair share of resources "
"(particularly disk, where it seems that 10% of the people use 90% of the "
"disk, no matter how big the disk is or how many people use it). Of "
"course, once disk hogs fill up one filesystem, they typically find some "
"other new one to infect, claiming to the sysadmin that they have an "
"important new project to complete."
