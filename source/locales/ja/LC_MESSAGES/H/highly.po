"[scientific computation] The preferred modifier for overstating an "
"understatement. As in: highly nonoptimal, the worst possible way to do "
"something; highly nontrivial, either impossible or requiring a major "
"research project; highly nonlinear, completely erratic and unpredictable;"
" highly nontechnical, drivel written for :ref:`luser`\\s, oversimplified "
"to the point of being misleading or incorrect (compare :ref:`drool-proof-"
"paper`\\). In other computing cultures, postfixing of :ref:`in-the-"
"extreme` might be preferred."
