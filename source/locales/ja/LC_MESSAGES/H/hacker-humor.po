"A distinctive style of shared intellectual humor found among hackers, "
"having the following marked characteristics:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../H/hacker-humor.rst:10
msgid ""
"Fascination with form-vs.-content jokes, paradoxes, and humor having to "
"do with confusion of metalevels (see :ref:`meta`\\). One way to make a "
"hacker laugh: hold a red index card in front of him/her with \"GREEN\" "
"written on it, or vice-versa (note, however, that this is funny only the "
"first time)."

#: ../../H/hacker-humor.rst:14
msgid ""
"Elaborate deadpan parodies of large intellectual constructs, such as "
"specifications (see :ref:`write-only-memory`\\), standards documents, "
"language descriptions (see :ref:`INTERCAL`\\), and even entire scientific"
" theories (see :ref:`quantum-bogodynamics`\\, :ref:`computron`\\)."

#: ../../H/hacker-humor.rst:17
msgid ""
"Jokes that involve screwily precise reasoning from bizarre, ludicrous, or"
" just grossly counter-intuitive premises."

msgid "Fascination with puns and wordplay."

msgid ""
"A fondness for apparently mindless humor with subversive currents of "
"intelligence in it â€” for example, old Warner Brothers and Rocky & "
"Bullwinkle cartoons, the Marx brothers, the early B-52s, and Monty "
"Python's Flying Circus. Humor that combines this trait with elements of "
"high camp and slapstick is especially favored."

"References to the symbol-object antinomies and associated ideas in Zen "
"Buddhism and (less often) Taoism. See :ref:`has-the-X-nature`\\, "
":ref:`Discordianism`\\, :ref:`zen`\\, :ref:`ha-ha-only-serious`\\, "
":ref:`koan`\\."

"See also :ref:`filk`\\, :ref:`retrocomputing`\\, and the Portrait of J. "
"Random Hacker in :ref:`Appendix B<appendixb>`\\. If you have an itchy "
"feeling that all six of these traits are really aspects of one thing that"
" is incredibly difficult to talk about exactly, you are (a) correct and "
"(b) responding like a hacker. These traits are also recognizable (though "
"in a less marked form) throughout :ref:`science-fiction-fandom`\\."
