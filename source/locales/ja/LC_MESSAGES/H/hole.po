"A region in an otherwise :ref:`flat` entity which is not actually "
"present. For example, some Unix filesystems can store large files with "
"holes so that unused regions of the file are never actually stored on "
"disk. (In techspeak, these are referred to as ‘sparse’ files.) As another"
" example, the region of memory in IBM PCs reserved for memory-mapped I/O "
"devices which may not actually be present is called ‘the I/O hole’, since"
" memory-management systems must skip over this area when filling user "
"requests for memory."
