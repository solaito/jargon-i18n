"[from ‘hung up’; common] Equivalent to :ref:`wedged`\\, but more common "
"at Unix/C sites. Not generally used of people. Syn. with :ref:`locked-"
"up`\\, :ref:`wedged`\\; compare :ref:`hosed`\\. See also :ref:`hang`\\. A"
" hung state is distinguished from :ref:`crash`\\ed or :ref:`down`\\, "
"where the program or system is also unusable but because it is not "
"running rather than because it is waiting for something. However, the "
"recovery from both situations is often the same. It is also distinguished"
" from the similar but more drastic state :ref:`wedged` — hung software "
"can be woken up with easy things like interrupt keys, but wedged will "
"need a kill -9 or even reboot."
