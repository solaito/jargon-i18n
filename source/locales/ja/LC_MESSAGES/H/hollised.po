"[Usenet: :samp:`sci.space`\\] To be hollised is to have been ordered by "
"one's employer not to post any even remotely job-related material to "
"Usenet (or, by extension, to other Internet media). The original and most"
" notorious case of this involved one Ken Hollis, a Lockheed employee and "
"space-program enthusiast who posted publicly available material on access"
" to Space Shuttle launches to :samp:`sci.space`\\. He was gagged under "
"threat of being fired in 1994 at the behest of NASA public-relations "
"officers. The result was, of course, a huge publicity black eye for NASA."
" Nevertheless several other NASA contractor employees were subsequently "
"hollised for similar activities. Use of this term carries the strong "
"connotation that the persons doing the gagging are bureaucratic idiots "
"blinded to their own best interests by territorial reflexes."
