"The high half of a 512K :ref:`PDP-10`\\'s physical address space; the "
"other half was of course the low moby. This usage has been generalized in"
" a way that has outlasted the :ref:`PDP-10`\\; for example, at the 1990 "
"Washington D.C. Area Science Fiction Conclave (Disclave), when a "
"miscommunication resulted in two separate wakes being held in "
"commemoration of the shutdown of MIT's last :ref:`ITS` machines, the one "
"on the upper floor was dubbed the ‘high moby’ and the other the ‘low "
"moby’. All parties involved :ref:`grok`\\ked this instantly. See "
":ref:`moby`\\."
