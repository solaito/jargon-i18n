"[from CB slang] An electronic pseudonym; a *nom de guerre* intended to "
"conceal the user's true identity. Network and BBS handles function as the"
" same sort of simultaneous concealment and display one finds on Citizen's"
" Band radio, from which the term was adopted. Use of grandiose handles is"
" characteristic of :ref:`warez-d00dz`\\, :ref:`cracker`\\s, "
":ref:`weenie`\\s, :ref:`spod`\\s, and other lower forms of network life; "
"true hackers travel on their own reputations rather than invented "
"legendry. Compare :ref:`nick`\\, :ref:`screen-name`\\."

"A :ref:`magic-cookie`\\, often in the form of a numeric index into some "
"array somewhere, through which you can manipulate an object like a file "
"or window. The form file handle is especially common."

"[Mac] A pointer to a pointer to dynamically-allocated memory; the extra "
"level of indirection allows on-the-fly memory compaction (to cut down on "
"fragmentation) or aging out of unused resources, with minimal impact on "
"the (possibly multiple) parts of the larger program containing references"
" to the allocated memory. Compare :ref:`snap` (to snap a handle would "
"defeat its purpose); see also :ref:`aliasing-bug`\\, :ref:`dangling-"
"pointer`\\."
