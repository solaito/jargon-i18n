"Mnemonic for ‘Halt and Catch Fire’, any of several undocumented and semi-"
"mythical machine instructions with destructive side-effects, supposedly "
"included for test purposes on several well-known architectures going as "
"far back as the IBM 360. The MC6800 microprocessor was the first for "
"which an HCF opcode became widely known. This instruction caused the "
"processor to :ref:`toggle` a subset of the bus lines as rapidly as it "
"could; in some configurations this could actually cause lines to burn up."
" Compare :ref:`killer-poke`\\."
