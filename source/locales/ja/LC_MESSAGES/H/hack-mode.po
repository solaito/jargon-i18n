"More specifically, a Zen-like state of total focus on The Problem that "
"may be achieved when one is hacking (this is why every good hacker is "
"part mystic). Ability to enter such concentration at will correlates "
"strongly with wizardliness; it is one of the most important skills "
"learned during :ref:`larval-stage`\\. Sometimes amplified as deep hack "
"mode."

"Being yanked out of hack mode (see :ref:`priority-interrupt`\\) may be "
"experienced as a physical shock, and the sensation of being in hack mode "
"is more than a little habituating. The intensity of this experience is "
"probably by itself sufficient explanation for the existence of hackers, "
"and explains why many resist being promoted out of positions where they "
"can code. See also :ref:`cyberspace` (sense 3)."

"Some aspects of hacker etiquette will appear quite odd to an observer "
"unaware of the high value placed on hack mode. For example, if someone "
"appears at your door, it is perfectly okay to hold up a hand (without "
"turning one's eyes away from the screen) to avoid being interrupted. One "
"may read, type, and interact with the computer for quite some time before"
" further acknowledging the other's presence (of course, he or she is "
"reciprocally free to leave without a word). The understanding is that you"
" might be in :ref:`hack-mode` with a lot of delicate :ref:`state` (sense "
"2) in your head, and you dare not :ref:`swap` that context out until you "
"have reached a good point to pause. See also :ref:`juggling-eggs`\\."
