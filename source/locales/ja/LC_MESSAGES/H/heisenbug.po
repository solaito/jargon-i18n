"[from Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle in quantum physics] A bug that "
"disappears or alters its behavior when one attempts to probe or isolate "
"it. (This usage is not even particularly fanciful; the use of a debugger "
"sometimes alters a program's operating environment significantly enough "
"that buggy code, such as that which relies on the values of uninitialized"
" memory, behaves quite differently.) Antonym of :ref:`Bohr-bug`\\; see "
"also :ref:`mandelbug`\\, :ref:`schroedinbug`\\. In C, nine out of ten "
"heisenbugs result from uninitialized auto variables, :ref:`fandango-on-"
"core` phenomena (esp. lossage related to corruption of the malloc "
":ref:`arena`\\) or errors that :ref:`smash-the-stack`\\."
