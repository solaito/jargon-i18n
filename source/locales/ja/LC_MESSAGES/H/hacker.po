"A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems and how"
" to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most users, who prefer to "
"learn only the minimum necessary. RFC1392, the *Internet Users' "
"Glossary*\\, usefully amplifies this as: A person who delights in having "
"an intimate understanding of the internal workings of a system, computers"
" and computer networks in particular."

"An expert at a particular program, or one who frequently does work using "

"[deprecated] A malicious meddler who tries to discover sensitive "

"The term ‘hacker’ also tends to connote membership in the global "
"community defined by the net (see :ref:`the-network`\\. For discussion of"
" some of the basics of this culture, see the `How To Become A Hacker "
"<http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html>`_\\  FAQ. It also "

"It is better to be described as a hacker by others than to describe "
"oneself that way. Hackers consider themselves something of an elite (a "
"meritocracy based on ability), though one to which new members are gladly"
" welcome. There is thus a certain ego satisfaction to be had in "
"identifying yourself as a hacker (but if you claim to be one and are not,"
" you'll quickly be labeled :ref:`bogus`\\). See also :ref:`geek`\\, "
":ref:`wannabee`\\."

"This term seems to have been first adopted as a badge in the 1960s by the"
" hacker culture surrounding TMRC and the MIT AI Lab. We have a report "
"that it was used in a sense close to this entry's by teenage radio hams "
"and electronics tinkerers in the mid-1950s."
