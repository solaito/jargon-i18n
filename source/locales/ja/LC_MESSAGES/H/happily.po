"Of software, used to emphasize that a program is unaware of some "
"important fact about its environment, either because it has been fooled "
"into believing a lie, or because it doesn't care. The sense of ‘happy’ "
"here is not that of elation, but rather that of blissful ignorance. \"The"
" program continues to run, happily unaware that its output is going to "
"/dev/null.\" Also used to suggest that a program or device would really "
"rather be doing something destructive, and is being given an opportunity "
"to do so. \"If you enter an O here instead of a zero, the program will "
"happily erase all your data.\" Nevertheless, use of this term implies a "
"basically benign attitude towards the program: It didn't mean any harm, "
"it was just eager to do its job. We'd like to be angry at it but we "
"shouldn't, we should try to understand it instead. The adjective "
"\"cheerfully\" is often used in exactly the same way."
