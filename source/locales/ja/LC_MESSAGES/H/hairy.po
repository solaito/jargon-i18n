"There is a theorem in simplicial homology theory which states that any "
"continuous tangent field on a 2-sphere is null at least in a point. "
"Mathematically literate hackers tend to associate the term ‘hairy’ with "
"the informal version of this theorem; \"You can't comb a hairy ball "
"smooth.\" (Previous versions of this entry associating the above informal"
" statement with the Brouwer fixed-point theorem were incorrect.)"

"The adjective ‘long-haired’ is well-attested to have been in slang use "
"among scientists and engineers during the early 1950s; it was equivalent "
"to modern hairy senses 1 and 2, and was very likely ancestral to the "
"hackish use. In fact the noun ‘long-hair’ was at the time used to "
"describe a person satisfying sense 3. Both senses probably passed out of "
"use when long hair was adopted as a signature trait by the 1960s "
"counterculture, leaving hackish hairy as a sort of stunted mutant relic."

"In British mainstream use, \"hairy\" means \"dangerous\", and "
"consequently, in British programming terms, \"hairy\" may be used to "
"denote complicated and/or incomprehensible code, but only if that "
"complexity or incomprehesiveness is also considered dangerous."
