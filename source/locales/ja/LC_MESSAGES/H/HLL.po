"[High-Level Language (as opposed to assembler)] Found primarily in email "
"and news rather than speech. Rarely, the variants ‘VHLL’ and ‘MLL’ are "
"found. VHLL stands for ‘Very-High-Level Language’ and is used to describe"
" a :ref:`bondage-and-discipline-language` that the speaker happens to "
"like; Prolog and Backus's FP are often called VHLLs. ‘MLL’ stands for "
"‘Medium-Level Language’ and is sometimes used half-jokingly to describe "
":ref:`C`\\, alluding to its ‘structured-assembler’ image. See also :ref"
":`languages-of-choice`\\."
