"Unflattering hackerism for HP-UX, Hewlett-Packard's Unix port, which "
"features some truly unique bogosities in the filesystem internals and "
"elsewhere (these occasionally create portability problems). HP-UX is "
"often referred to as ‘hockey-pux’ inside HP, and one respondent claims "
"that the proper pronunciation is /H·P ukkkhhhh/ as though one were about "
"to spit. Another such alternate spelling and pronunciation is \"H-PUX\" "
"/H-puhks/. Hackers at HP/Apollo (the former Apollo Computers which was "
"swallowed by HP in 1989) have been heard to complain that Mr. Packard "
"should have pushed to have his name first, if for no other reason than "
"the greater eloquence of the resulting acronym. See :ref:`sun-stools`\\, "
":ref:`Slowlaris`\\."
