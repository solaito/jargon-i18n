"Same as :ref:`down`\\. Used primarily by Unix hackers. Humorous: also "
"implies a condition thought to be relatively easy to reverse. Probably "
"derived from the Canadian slang ‘hoser’ popularized by the Bob and Doug "
"Mackenzie skits on SCTV, but this usage predated SCTV by years in "
"hackerdom (it was certainly already live at CMU in the 1970s). See "
":ref:`hose`\\. It is also widely used of people in the mainstream sense "
"of ‘in an extremely unfortunate situation’."

"Once upon a time, a Cray that had been experiencing periodic difficulties"
" crashed, and it was announced to have been hosed. It was discovered that"
" the crash was due to the disconnection of some coolant hoses. The "
"problem was corrected, and users were then assured that everything was OK"
" because the system had been rehosed. See also :ref:`dehose`\\."
