"A derogatory play on ‘Unix wizard’, common among hackers who use Unix by "
"necessity but would prefer alternatives. The implication is that although"
" the person in question may consider mastery of Unix arcana to be a "
"wizardly skill, the only real skill involved is the ability to tolerate "
"(and the bad taste to wallow in) the incoherence and needless complexity "
"that is alleged to infest many Unix programs. \"This shell script tries "
"to parse its arguments in 69 bletcherous ways. It must have been written "
"by a real Unix weenie.\""
