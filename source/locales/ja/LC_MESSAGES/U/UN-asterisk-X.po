"Used to refer to the Unix operating system (a trademark of AT&T, then of "
"Novell, then of Unix Systems Laboratories, then of the Open Group; the "
"source code parted company with it after Novell and was owned by SCO, "
"which was acquired by Caldera) in writing, but avoiding the need for the "
"ugly ™ typography (see also :ref:`TM`\\). Also used to refer to any or "
"all varieties of Unixoid operating systems. Ironically, lawyers now say "
"that the requirement for the trademark postfix has no legal force, but "
"the asterisk usage is entrenched anyhow. It has been suggested that there"
" may be a psychological connection to practice in certain religions "
"(especially Judaism) in which the name of the deity is never written out "
"in full, e.g., ‘YHWH’ or ‘G--d’ is used. See also :ref:`glob` and :ref"
":`splat-out`\\."
