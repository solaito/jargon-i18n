"This object is historically one of the first complex 3D models to be "
"rendered in computer graphics. It consisted of about 110 vertices, and "
"was generated by Martin Newell in 1974 using hand-drawn Bezier curves, "
"based on a real teapot that he and his wife had bought. This model served"
" as a basis for comparing various 3D rendering methodologies for "
"lighting, textures, bump-mapping, etc. By the standards of 2002, the "
"model is trivial to render and thus is often not suited to demonstrate "
"the complexity of modern research. Despite this, the tea pot still "
"appears, now and then, in recent papers. More on the teapot's history "
"lives at `The History Of The Teapot <http://www.sjbaker.org/teapot/>`_. "
