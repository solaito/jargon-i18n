"[from ‘Users' Network’; the original spelling was USENET, but the mixed-"
"case form is now widely preferred] A distributed :ref:`bboard` (bulletin "
"board) system supported mainly by Unix machines. Originally implemented "
"in 1979--1980 by Steve Bellovin, Jim Ellis, Tom Truscott, and Steve "
"Daniel at Duke University and the University of North Carolina, it has "
"swiftly grown to become international in scope and is now probably the "
"largest decentralized information utility in existence. As of late 2002, "
"it hosts over 100,000 :ref:`newsgroup`\\s and an unguessably huge volume "
"of new technical articles, news, discussion, chatter, and :ref:`flamage` "
"every day (and that leaves out the graphics...)."

"By the year the Internet hit the mainstream (1994) the original UUCP "
"transport for Usenet was fading out of use — almost all Usenet "
"connections were over Internet links. A lot of newbies and journalists "
"began to refer to \"Internet newsgroups\" as though Usenet was and always"
" had been just another Internet service. This ignorance greatly annoys "
"experienced Usenetters."
