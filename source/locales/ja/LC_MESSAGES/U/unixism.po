"A piece of code or a coding technique that depends on the protected "
"multi-tasking environment with relatively low process-spawn overhead that"
" exists on virtual-memory Unix systems. Common :ref:`unixism`\\s include:"
" gratuitous use of :manpage:`fork(2)`\\; the assumption that certain "
"undocumented but well-known features of Unix libraries such as "
":manpage:`stdio(3)` are supported elsewhere; reliance on :ref:`obscure` "
"side-effects of system calls (use of :manpage:`sleep(2)` with a 0 "
"argument to clue the scheduler that you're willing to give up your time-"
"slice, for example); the assumption that freshly allocated memory is "
"zeroed; and the assumption that fragmentation problems won't arise from "
"never :manpage:`free()`\\ing memory. Compare :ref:`vaxocentrism`\\; see "
"also :ref:`New-Jersey`\\."
