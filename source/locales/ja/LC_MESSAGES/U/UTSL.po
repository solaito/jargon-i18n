"[Unix] On-line acronym for ‘Use the Source, Luke’ (a pun on Obi-Wan "
"Kenobi's \"Use the Force, Luke!\" in *Star Wars*\\) — analogous to "
":ref:`RTFS` (sense 1), but more polite. This is a common way of "
"suggesting that someone would be better off reading the source code that "
"supports whatever feature is causing confusion, rather than making yet "
"another futile pass through the manuals, or broadcasting questions on "
"Usenet that haven't attracted :ref:`wizard`\\s to answer them."

"Once upon a time in :ref:`elder-days`\\, everyone running Unix had "
"source. After 1978, AT&T's policy tightened up, so this objurgation was "
"in theory appropriately directed only at associates of some outfit with a"
" Unix source license. In practice, bootlegs of Unix source code (made "
"precisely for reference purposes) were so ubiquitous that one could utter"
" it at almost anyone on the network without concern."

"Nowadays, free Unix clones have become widely enough distributed that "
"anyone can read source legally. The most widely distributed is certainly "
"Linux, with variants of the NET/2 and 4.4BSD distributions running "
"second. Cheap commercial Unixes with source such as BSD/OS are "
"accelerating this trend."
