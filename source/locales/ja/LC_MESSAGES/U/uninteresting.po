"Hackers regard uninteresting problems as intolerable wastes of time, to "
"be solved (if at all) by lesser mortals.*Real* hackers (see "
":ref:`toolsmith`\\) generalize uninteresting problems enough to make them"
" interesting and solve them â€” thus solving the original problem as a "
"special case (and, it must be admitted, occasionally turning a molehill "
"into a mountain, or a mountain into a tectonic plate). See "
":ref:`WOMBAT`\\, :ref:`SMOP`\\; compare :ref:`toy-problem`\\, oppose "
