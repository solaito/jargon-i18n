"Something that has to be done to break a network program (typically a "
"mailer) on a non-Unix system so that it will interoperate with Unix "
"systems. The hack may qualify as Unix brain damage if the program "
"conforms to published standards and the Unix program in question does "
"not. Unix brain damage happens because it is much easier for other "
"(minority) systems to change their ways to match non-conforming behavior "
"than it is to change all the hundreds of thousands of Unix systems out "
"there."

"An example of Unix brain damage is a :ref:`kluge` in a mail server to "
"recognize bare line feed (the Unix newline) as an equivalent form to the "
"Internet standard newline, which is a carriage return followed by a line "
"feed. Such things can make even a hardened :ref:`jock` weep."
