"[common] Towards the original author(s) or maintainer(s) of a project. "
"Used in connection with software that is distributed both in its original"
" source form and in derived, adapted versions through a distribution "
"(like the Debian version of Linux or one of the BSD ports) that has "
"component maintainers for each of their parts. When a component "
"maintainer receives a bug report or patch, he may choose to retain the "
"patch as a porting tweak to the distribution's derivative of the project,"
" or to pass it upstream to the project's maintainer. The antonym "
"downstream is rare."
