"[In the authors' words, \"A weak pun on Multics\"; very early on it was "
"\"UNICS\"] (also \"UNIX\") An interactive timesharing system invented in "
"1969 by Ken Thompson after Bell Labs left the Multics project, originally"
" so he could play games on his scavenged PDP-7. Dennis Ritchie, the "
"inventor of C, is considered a co-author of the system. The turning point"
" in Unix's history came when it was reimplemented almost entirely in C "
"during 1972—1974, making it the first source-portable OS. Unix "
"subsequently underwent mutations and expansions at the hands of many "
"different people, resulting in a uniquely flexible and developer-friendly"
" environment. By 1991, Unix had become the most widely used multiuser "
"general-purpose operating system in the world — and since 1996 the "
"variant called :ref:`Linux` has been at the cutting edge of the :ref"
":`open-source` movement. Many people consider the success of Unix the "
"most important victory yet of hackerdom over industry opposition (but see"
" :ref:`Unix-weenie` and :ref:`Unix-conspiracy` for an opposing point of "
"view). See :ref:`Version-7`\\, :ref:`BSD`\\, :ref:`Linux`\\."

"Some people are confused over whether this word is appropriately ‘UNIX’ "
"or ‘Unix’; both forms are common, and used interchangeably. Dennis "
"Ritchie says that the ‘UNIX’ spelling originally happened in CACM's 1974 "
"paper *The UNIX Time-Sharing System* because \"we had a new typesetter "
"and :ref:`troff` had just been invented and we were intoxicated by being "
"able to produce small caps.\" Later, dmr tried to get the spelling "
"changed to ‘Unix’ in a couple of Bell Labs papers, on the grounds that "
"the word is not acronymic. He failed, and eventually (his words) \"wimped"
" out\" on the issue. So, while the trademark today is ‘UNIX’, both "
"capitalizations are grounded in ancient usage; the Jargon File uses "
"‘Unix’ in deference to dmr's wishes."
