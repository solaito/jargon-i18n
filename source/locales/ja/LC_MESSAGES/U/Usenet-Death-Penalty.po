"[Usenet] A sanction against sites that habitually spew Usenet "
":ref:`spam`\\. This can be either passive or active. A passive UDP refers"
" to the dropping of all postings by a particular domain so as to inhibit "
"propagation. An active UDP refers to third-party cancellation of all "
"postings by the UDPed domain. A partial UDP is one which applies only to "
"certain newsgroups or hierarchies in Usenet. Compare :ref:`Internet-"
"Death-Penalty`\\, with which this term is sometimes confused."
