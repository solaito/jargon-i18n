"Someone doing ‘real work’ with the computer, using it as a means rather "

"A programmer who will believe anything you tell him. One who asks silly "
"questions. [GLS observes: This is slightly unfair. It is true that users "
"ask questions (of necessity). Sometimes they are thoughtful or deep. Very"
" often they are annoying or downright stupid, apparently because the user"
" failed to think for two seconds or look in the documentation before "
"bothering the maintainer.] See :ref:`luser`\\."

"Someone who uses a program from the outside, however skillfully, without "
"getting into the internals of the program. One who reports bugs instead "
"of just going ahead and fixing them."

"The general theory behind this term is that there are two classes of "
"people who work with a program: there are implementors (hackers) and "
":ref:`luser`\\s. The users are looked down on by hackers to some extent "
"because they don't understand the full ramifications of the system in all"
" its glory. (The few users who do are known as real winners.) The term is"
" a relative one: a skilled hacker may be a user with respect to some "
"program he himself does not hack. A LISP hacker might be one who "
"maintains LISP or one who uses LISP (but with the skill of a hacker). A "
"LISP user is one who uses LISP, whether skillfully or not. Thus there is "
"some overlap between the two terms; the subtle distinctions must be "
"resolved by context."
