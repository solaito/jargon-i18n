"Technically, a machine's time since last reboot; jargonically, how long a"
" hacker has gone without sleep. \"What's your uptime?\" \"Oh, about 28 "
"hours so far, but I think I can probably do another 12.\" This is, of "
"course, a reference to the uptime command and the pride with which most "
"Unix types note how long their computers go without reboots. Uptime is a "
"testament to the stability of the OS and the stamina of the hacker."
