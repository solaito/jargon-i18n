"[Usenet; very common] (alt. : KILL file) Per-user file(s) used by some "
":ref:`Usenet` reading programs (originally Larry Wall's "
":manpage:`rn(1)`\\) to discard summarily (without presenting for reading)"
" articles matching some particularly uninteresting (or unwanted) patterns"
" of subject, author, or other header lines. Thus to add a person (or "
"subject) to one's kill file is to arrange for that person to be ignored "
"by one's newsreader in future. By extension, it may be used for a "
"decision to ignore the person or subject in other media. See also "
":ref:`plonk`\\."
