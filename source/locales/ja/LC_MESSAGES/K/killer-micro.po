"[popularized by Eugene Brooks c.1990] A microprocessor-based machine that"
" infringes on mini, mainframe, or supercomputer performance turf. Often "
"heard in \"No one will survive the attack of the killer micros! \", the "
"battle cry of the downsizers."

"The popularity of the phrase ‘attack of the killer micros’ is doubtless "
"reinforced by the title of the movie *Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes* (one"
" of the :ref:`canonical` examples of so-bad-it's-wonderful among "
"hackers). This has even more :ref:`flavor` now that killer micros have "
"gone on the offensive not just individually (in workstations) but in "
"hordes (within massively parallel computers)."

" networked killer micros as far as the eye can see. —ESR]"
