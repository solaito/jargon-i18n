"[Usenet; poss. : fr. : :ref:`DEC` slang for a full software distribution,"
" as opposed to a patch or upgrade] A source software distribution that "
"has been packaged in such a way that it can (theoretically) be unpacked "
"and installed according to a series of steps using only standard Unix "
"tools, and entirely documented by some reasonable chain of references "
"from the top-level :ref:`README-file`\\. The more general term "
":ref:`distribution` may imply that special tools or more stringent "
"conditions on the host environment are required."
