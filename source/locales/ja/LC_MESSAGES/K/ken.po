"[Unix] Ken Thompson, principal inventor of Unix. In the early days he "
"used to hand-cut distribution tapes, often with a note that read \"Love, "
"ken\". Old-timers still use his first name (sometimes uncapitalized, "
"because it's a login name and mail address) in third-person reference; it"
" is widely understood (on Usenet, in particular) that without a last name"
" ‘Ken’ refers only to Ken Thompson. Similarly, ‘Dennis’ without last name"
" means Dennis Ritchie (and he is often known as :samp:`dmr`\\). See also "
":ref:`demigod`\\, :ref:`Unix`\\."
