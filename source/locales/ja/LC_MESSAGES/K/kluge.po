"Nowadays this term is often encountered in the variant spelling ‘kludge’."
" Reports from :ref:`old-fart`\\s are consistent that ‘kluge’ was the "
"original spelling, reported around computers as far back as the mid-1950s"
" and, at that time, used exclusively of *hardware* kluges. In 1947, the "
"*New York Folklore Quarterly* reported a classic shaggy-dog story "
"‘Murgatroyd the Kluge Maker’ then current in the Armed Forces, in which a"
" ‘kluge’ was a complex and puzzling artifact with a trivial function. "
"Other sources report that ‘kluge’ was common Navy slang in the WWII era "
"for any piece of electronics that worked well on shore but consistently "
"failed at sea."

"However, there is reason to believe this slang use may be a decade older."
" Several respondents have connected it to the brand name of a device "
"called a \"Kluge paper feeder\", an adjunct to mechanical printing "
"presses. Legend has it that the Kluge feeder was designed before small, "
"cheap electric motors and control electronics; it relied on a fiendishly "
"complex assortment of cams, belts, and linkages to both power and "
"synchronize all its operations from one motive driveshaft. It was "
"accordingly temperamental, subject to frequent breakdowns, and devilishly"
" difficult to repair — but oh, so clever! People who tell this story also"
" aver that ‘Kluge’ was the name of a design engineer."

"There is in fact a Brandtjen & Kluge Inc., an old family business that "
"manufactures printing equipment — interestingly, their name is pronounced"
" /kloo´gee/! Henry Brandtjen, president of the firm, told me (ESR, 1994) "
"that his company was co-founded by his father and an engineer named Kluge"
" /kloo´gee/, who built and co-designed the original Kluge automatic "
"feeder in 1919. Mr. Brandtjen claims, however, that this was a *simple* "
"device (with only four cams); he says he has no idea how the myth of its "
"complexity took hold. Other correspondents differ with Mr. Brandtjen's "
"history of the device and his allegation that it was a simple rather than"
" complex one, but agree that the Kluge automatic feeder was the most "
"likely source of the folklore."

":ref:`TMRC` and the MIT hacker culture of the early '60s seems to have "
"developed in a milieu that remembered and still used some WWII military "
"slang (see also :ref:`foobar`\\). It seems likely that ‘kluge’ came to "
"MIT via alumni of the many military electronics projects that had been "
"located in Cambridge (many in MIT's venerable Building 20, in which "
":ref:`TMRC` is also located) during the war."

"The variant ‘kludge’ was apparently popularized by the :ref:`Datamation` "
"article mentioned under :ref:`kludge`\\; it was titled *How to Design a "
"Kludge* (February 1962, pp. 30, 31). This spelling was probably imported "
"from Great Britain, where :ref:`kludge` has an independent history "
"(though this fact was largely unknown to hackers on either side of the "
"Atlantic before a mid-1993 debate in the Usenet group "
":samp:`alt.folklore.computers` over the First and Second Edition versions"
" of this entry; everybody used to think :ref:`kludge` was just a mutation"
" of :ref:`kluge`\\). It now appears that the British, having forgotten "
"the etymology of their own ‘kludge’ when ‘kluge’ crossed the Atlantic, "
"repaid the U.S. by lobbing the ‘kludge’ orthography in the other "
"direction and confusing their American cousins' spelling!"

"The result of this history is a tangle. Many younger U.S. hackers "
"pronounce the word as /klooj/ but spell it, incorrectly for its meaning "
"and pronunciation, as ‘kludge’. (Phonetically, consider huge, refuge, "
"centrifuge, and deluge as opposed to sludge, judge, budge, and fudge. "
"Whatever its failings in other areas, English spelling is perfectly "
"consistent about this distinction.) British hackers mostly learned "
"/kluhj/ orally, use it in a restricted negative sense and are at least "
"consistent. European hackers have mostly learned the word from written "
"American sources and tend to pronounce it /kluhj/ but use the wider "
"American meaning!"
