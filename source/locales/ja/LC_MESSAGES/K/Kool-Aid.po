"[from a kid's sugar-enriched drink in fruity flavors] When someone who "
"should know better succumbs to marketing influences and actually begins "
"to believe the propaganda being dished out by a vendor, they are said to "
"have drunk the Kool-Aid. Usually the decortication process is slow and "
"almost unnoticeable until one day the victim emerges as a True Believer "
"and begins spreading the faith himself. The term originates in the "
"suicide of 914 followers of Jim Jones's People's Temple cult in Guyana in"
" 1978 (there are also resonances with Ken Kesey's Electric Kool-Aid Acid "
"Tests from the 1960s). What the Jonestown victims actually drank was "
"cyanide-laced Flavor-Aid, a cheap knockoff, rather than Kool-Aid itself. "
"There is a `FAQ <http://www.cs.uu.nl/wais/html/na-dir/food/kool-aid-"
"faq.html>`_\\  on this topic."

"This has live variants. When a suit is blithering on about their latest "
"technology and how it will save the world, that's ‘pouring Kool-Aid’. "
"When the suit does not violate the laws of physics, doesn't make "
"impossible claims, and in fact says something reasonable and believable, "
"that's pouring good Kool-Aid, usually used in the sentence \"He pours "
"good Kool-Aid, doesn't he?\" This connotes that the speaker might be "
"about to drink same."
