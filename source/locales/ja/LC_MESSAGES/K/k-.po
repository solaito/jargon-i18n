"[rare; poss fr. kilo- prefix] Extremely. Rare among hackers, but quite "
"common among crackers and :ref:`warez-d00dz` in compounds such as k-kool "
"/K´kool´/, k-rad /K´rad´/, and k-awesome /K´aw\\`sm/. Also used to "
"intensify negatives; thus, k-evil, k-lame, k-screwed, and k-annoying. "
"Overuse of this prefix, or use in more formal or technical contexts, is "
"considered an indicator of :ref:`lamer` status."
