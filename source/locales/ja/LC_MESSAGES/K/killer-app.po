"The application that actually makes a sustaining market for a promising "
"but under-utilized technology. First used in the mid-1980s to describe "
"Lotus 1-2-3 once it became evident that demand for that product had been "
"the major driver of the early business market for IBM PCs. The term was "
"then retrospectively applied to VisiCalc, which had played a similar role"
" in the success of the Apple II. After 1994 it became commonplace to "
"describe the World Wide Web as the Internet's killer app. One of the "
"standard questions asked about each new personal-computer technology as "
"it emerges has become \"what's the killer app?\""
