"This word appears to have derived from Scots kludge or kludgie for a "
"common toilet, via British military slang. It apparently became confused "
"with U.S. :ref:`kluge` during or after World War II; some Britons from "
"that era use both words in definably different ways, but :ref:`kluge` is "
"now uncommon in Great Britain. ‘Kludge’ in Commonwealth hackish differs "
"in meaning from ‘kluge’ in that it lacks the positive senses; a kludge is"
" something no Commonwealth hacker wants to be associated too closely "
"with. Also, ‘kludge’ is more widely known in British mainstream slang "
"than ‘kluge’ is in the U.S."
