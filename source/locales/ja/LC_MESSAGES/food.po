"Ethnic. Spicy. Oriental, esp. Chinese and most esp. Szechuan, Hunan, and "
"Mandarin (hackers consider Cantonese vaguely *déclassé*\\). Hackers "
"prefer the exotic; for example, the Japanese-food fans among them will "
"eat with gusto such delicacies as fugu (poisonous pufferfish) and whale. "
"Thai food has experienced flurries of popularity. Where available, high-"
"quality Jewish delicatessen food is much esteemed. A visible minority of "
"Southwestern and Pacific Coast hackers prefers Mexican."

"Interestingly, though the mainstream culture has tended to think of "
"hackers as incorrigible junk-food junkies, many have at least mildly "
"health-foodist attitudes and are fairly discriminating about what they "
"eat. This may be generational; anecdotal evidence suggests that the "
"stereotype was more on the mark before the early 1980s."
