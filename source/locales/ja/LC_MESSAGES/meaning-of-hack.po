"\"The word :ref:`hack` doesn't really have 69 different meanings\", "
"according to MIT hacker Phil Agre. \"In fact, :ref:`hack` has only one "
"meaning, an extremely subtle and profound one which defies articulation. "
"Which connotation is implied by a given use of the word depends in "
"similarly profound ways on the context. Similar remarks apply to a couple"
" of other hacker words, most notably :ref:`random`\\.\""

"Hacking might be characterized as ‘an appropriate application of "
"ingenuity’. Whether the result is a quick-and-dirty patchwork job or a "
"carefully crafted work of art, you have to admire the cleverness that "
"went into it."

"An important secondary meaning of :ref:`hack` is ‘a creative practical "
"joke’. This kind of hack is easier to explain to non-hackers than the "
"programming kind. Of course, some hacks have both natures; see the "
"lexicon entries for :ref:`pseudo` and :ref:`kgbvax`\\. But here are some "
"examples of pure practical jokes that illustrate the hacking spirit:"

"The hacks above are verifiable history; they can be proved to have "
"happened. Many other classic-hack stories from MIT and elsewhere, though "
"retold as history, have the characteristics of what Jan Brunvand has "
"called ‘urban folklore’ (see :ref:`FOAF`\\). Perhaps the best known of "
"these is the legend of the infamous trolley-car hack, an alleged incident"
" in which engineering students are said to have welded a trolley car to "
"its tracks with thermite. Numerous versions of this have been recorded "
"from the 1940s to the present, most set at MIT but at least one very "
"detailed version set at CMU."

"Brian Leibowitz has researched MIT hacks both real and mythical "
"extensively; the interested reader is referred to his delightful "
"pictorial compendium *The Journal of the Institute for Hacks, Tomfoolery,"
" andPranks* (MIT Museum, 1990; ISBN 0-917027-03-5). The Institute has a "
"World Wide Web page at `http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/Gallery.html "
"<http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/Gallery.html>`_. There is a sequel entitled "
"*Is This The Way To Baker House?*\\. The Caltech Alumni Association has "

"1990's addition to the hallowed tradition of April Fool RFCs was RFC "
"1149, *A Standard for the Transmission of IP Datagrams on "
"AvianCarriers*\\. This sketched a method for transmitting IP packets via "
"carrier pigeons."

"Eleven years later, on 28 April 2001, the Bergen Linux User's Group "
"successfully demonstrated CPIP (Carrier Pigeon IP) between two Linux "
"machines running on opposite sides of a small mountain in Bergen, Norway."
" Their network stack used printers to hex-dump packets onto paper, "
"pigeons to transport the paper, and OCR software to read the dumps at the"
" other end and feed them to the receiving machine's network layer."

"While all acknowledged the magnitude of this achievement, some debate "
"ensued over whether BLUG's implementation was properly conformant to the "
"RFC. It seems they had not used the duct tape specified in 1149 to attach"
" messages to pigeon legs, but instead employed other methods less "
"objectionable to the pigeons. The debate was properly resolved when it "
"was pointed out that the duct-tape specification was not prefixed by a "
"MUST, and was thus a recommendation rather than a requirement."

"The perpetrators finished their preliminary writeup in this wise: \"Now, "
