"\"Allow none of :ref:`foo`\\, one of :ref:`foo`\\, or any number of "
":ref:`foo`\\.\" A rule of thumb for software design, which instructs one "
"to not place :ref:`random` limits on the number of instances of a given "
"entity (such as: windows in a window system, letters in an OS's "
"filenames, etc.). Specifically, one should either disallow the entity "
"entirely, allow exactly one instance (an \"exception\"), or allow as many"
" as the user wants — address space and memory permitting."

"The logic behind this rule is that there are often situations where it "
"makes clear sense to allow one of something instead of none. However, if "
"one decides to go further and allow N (for N > 1), then why not N+1? And "
"if N+1, then why not N+2, and so on? Once above 1, there's no excuse not "
"to allow any N; hence, :ref:`infinity`\\."

"Many hackers recall in this connection Isaac Asimov's SF novel *The Gods "
"Themselves* in which a character announces that the number 2 is "
"impossible — if you're going to believe in more than one universe, you "
"might as well believe in an infinite number of them."
