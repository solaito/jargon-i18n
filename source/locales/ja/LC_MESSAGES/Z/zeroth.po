"First. Among software designers, comes from C's and LISP's 0-based "
"indexing of arrays. Hardware people also tend to start counting at 0 "
"instead of 1; this is natural since, e.g., the 256 states of 8 bits "
"correspond to the binary numbers 0, 1, ..., 255 and the digital devices "
"known as counters count in this way."

"Hackers and computer scientists often like to call the first chapter of a"
" publication ‘Chapter 0’, especially if it is of an introductory nature "
"(one of the classic instances was in the First Edition of "
":ref:`K-ampersand-R`\\). In recent years this trait has also been "
"observed among many pure mathematicians (who have an independent "
"tradition of numbering from 0). Zero-based numbering tends to reduce :ref"
":`fencepost-error`\\s, though it cannot eliminate them entirely."
