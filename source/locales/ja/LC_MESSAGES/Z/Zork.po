"distributed with BSD Unix (as a patched, sourceless RT-11 FORTRAN binary;"
" see :ref:`retrocomputing`\\) and commercialized as ‘The Zork Trilogy’ by"
" :ref:`Infocom`\\. The FORTRAN source was later rewritten for portability"
" and released to Usenet under the name \"Dungeon\". Both FORTRAN "
"\"Dungeon\" and translated C versions are available at many FTP sites; "
"the commercial Zork trilogy is available at `http://www.ifarchive.org/ "
"<http://www.ifarchive.org/>`_. See also :ref:`grue`\\. You can play Zork "
