"\"Every program attempts to expand until it can read mail. Those programs"
" which cannot so expand are replaced by ones which can.\" Coined by Jamie"
" Zawinski (who called it the \"Law of Software Envelopment\") to express "
"his belief that all truly useful programs experience pressure to evolve "
"into toolkits and application platforms (the mailer thing, he says, is "
"just a side effect of that). It is commonly cited, though with widely "
"varying degrees of accuracy."
