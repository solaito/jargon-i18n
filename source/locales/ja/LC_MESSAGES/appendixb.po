"This profile reflects detailed comments on an earlier ‘trial balloon’ "
"version from about a hundred Usenet respondents. Where comparatives are "
"used, the implicit ‘other’ is a randomly selected segment of the non-"
"hacker population of the same size as hackerdom."

"An important point: Except in some relatively minor respects such as "
"slang vocabulary, hackers don't get to be the way they are by imitating "
"each other. Rather, it seems to be the case that the combination of "
"personality traits that makes a hacker so conditions one's outlook on "
"life that one tends to end up being like other hackers whether one wants "
"to or not (much as bizarrely detailed similarities in behavior and "
"preferences are found in genetic twins raised separately)."
