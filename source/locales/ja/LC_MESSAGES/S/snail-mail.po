"Paper mail, as opposed to electronic. Sometimes written as the single "
"word ‘SnailMail’. One's postal address is, correspondingly, a snail "
"address. Derives from earlier coinage ‘USnail’ (from ‘U.S. Mail’), for "
"which there have even been parody posters and stamps made. Also (less "
"commonly) called P-mail, from ‘paper mail’ or ‘physical mail’. Oppose "
":ref:`email`\\."

"(Note: Actual garden snails progress at about 10 meters per hour, which "
"is about 25-50 times slower than the U.K.'s Royal Mail; comparable "
"measurements for other countries have not yet been made. More "
"biologically apt terms might be \"sloth-mail\" at 250 m/hr or \"tortoise-"
"mail\" at 270 m/hr. See "
