"urban legend. It's not borne out by an examination of medieval recipes or"
" period purchase records for spices, and appears full-blown in the works "
"of Samuel Pegge, a gourmand and notorious flake case who originated "
"numerous food myths. The truth seems to be that ginger was used to cover "
"not rot but the extreme salt taste of meat packed in brine, which was the"
" best method available before refrigeration. —ESR]"
