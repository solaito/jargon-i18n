"To capture, alter, and retransmit a communication stream in a way that "
"misleads the recipient. As used by hackers, refers especially to altering"
" TCP/IP packet source addresses or other packet-header data in order to "
"masquerade as a trusted machine. This term has become very widespread and"
" is borderline techspeak. Interestingly, it was already in use in its "
