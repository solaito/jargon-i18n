"[very common] The lowest form of :ref:`cracker`\\; script kiddies do "
"mischief with scripts and :ref:`rootkit`\\s written by others, often "
"without understanding the :ref:`exploit` they are using. Used of people "
"with limited technical expertise using easy-to-operate, pre-configured, "
"and/or automated tools to conduct disruptive activities against networked"
" systems. Since most of these tools are fairly well-known by the security"
" community, the adverse impact of such actions is usually minimal."

"having or desiring to have a mental model of what the code does; someone "
"who thinks of code as magical incantations and asks only \"what do I need"
