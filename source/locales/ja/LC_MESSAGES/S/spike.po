"To defeat a selection mechanism by introducing a (sometimes temporary) "
"device that forces a specific result. The word is used in several "
"industries; telephone engineers refer to spiking a relay by inserting a "
"pin to hold the relay in either the closed or open state, and railroaders"
" refer to spiking a track switch so that it cannot be moved. In "
"programming environments it normally refers to a temporary change, "
"usually for testing purposes (as opposed to a permanent change, which "
"would be called :ref:`hardwired`\\)."

"[borderline techspeak] A visible peak in an otherwise rather constant "
"graph (e.g. a sudden surge in line voltage, an unexpected short \"high\" "
"on a logical line in a circuit). Hackers frequently use this for a sudden"
" short increase in some quantity such as system load or network traffic."
