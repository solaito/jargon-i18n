"[techspeak] To move information from a fast-access memory to a slow-"
"access memory (swap out), or vice versa (swap in). Often refers "
"specifically to the use of disks as virtual memory. As pieces of data or "
"program are needed, they are swapped into :ref:`core` for processing; "
"when they are no longer needed they may be swapped out again."

"The jargon use of these terms analogizes people's short-term memories "
"with core. Cramming for an exam might be spoken of as swapping in. If you"
" temporarily forget someone's name, but then remember it, your excuse is "
"that it was swapped out. To keep something swapped in means to keep it "
"fresh in your memory: \"I reread the TECO manual every few months to keep"
" it swapped in.\" If someone interrupts you just as you got a good idea, "
"you might say \"Wait a moment while I swap this out\", implying that a "
"piece of paper is your extra-somatic memory and that if you don't swap "
"the idea out by writing it down it will get overwritten and lost as you "
"talk. Compare :ref:`page-in`\\, :ref:`page-out`\\."
