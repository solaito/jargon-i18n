"[common] A beast that randomly chooses one of a selection of signatures "
"for appending to mail and news messages. The creature is most often "
"mentioned directly when it has been in particularly good form and "
"selected a signature appropriate to the topic being discussed; the "
"construction \"P.S. : good sigmonster, have a cookie\" is not uncommon. "
"While the are sigmonster programs floating around on the net, most "
"hackers who keep one use a silly little Perl or Python script that they "
"threw together in the middle of the night under the influence of far too "
"much caffeine."
