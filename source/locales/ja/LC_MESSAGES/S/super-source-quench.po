"A special packet designed to shut up an Internet host. The Internet "
"Protocol (IP) has a control message called Source Quench that asks a host"
" to transmit more slowly on a particular connection to avoid congestion. "
"It also has a Redirect control message intended to instruct a host to "
"send certain packets to a different local router. A \"super source "
"quench\" is actually a redirect control packet, forged to look like it "
"came from a local router, that instructs a host to send all packets to "
"its own local loopback address. This will effectively tie many Internet "
"hosts up in knots. Compare :ref:`Godzillagram`\\, :ref:`breath-of-life-"
"packet`\\."
