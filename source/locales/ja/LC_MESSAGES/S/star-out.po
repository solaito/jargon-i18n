"[University of York, England] To replace a user's encrypted password in "
"/etc/passwd with a single asterisk. Under Unix this is not a legal "
"encryption of any password; hence the user is not permitted to log in. In"
" general, accounts like adm, news, and daemon are permanently \"starred "
"out\"; occasionally a real user might have this inflicted upon him/her as"
" a punishment, e.g. \"Graham was starred out for playing Omega in working"
" hours\". Also occasionally known as The Order Of The Gold Star in this "
"context. \"Don't do that, or you'll be awarded the Order of the Gold "
"Star...\" Compare :ref:`disusered`\\."
