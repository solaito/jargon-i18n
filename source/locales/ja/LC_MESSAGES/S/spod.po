"A lower form of life found on :ref:`talker-system`\\s and :ref:`MUD`\\s. "
"The spod has few friends in :ref:`RL` and uses talkers instead, finding "
"communication easier and preferable over the net. He has all the negative"
" traits of the computer geek without having any interest in computers per"
" se. Lacking any knowledge of or interest in how networks work, and "
"considering his access a God-given right, he is a major irritant to "
"sysadmins, clogging up lines in order to reach new MUDs, following "
"passed-on instructions on how to sneak his way onto Internet (\"Wow! It's"
" in America!\") and complaining when he is not allowed to use busy "
"routes. A true spod will start any conversation with \"Are you male or "
"female?\" (and follow it up with \"Got any good numbers/IDs/passwords?\")"
" and will not talk to someone physically present in the same terminal "
"room until they log onto the same machine that he is using and enter talk"
" mode. 2. An experienced talker user. As with the defiant adoption of the"
" term geek in the mid-1990s by people who would previously have been "
"stigmatized by it, the term \"spod\" is now used as a mark of distinction"
" by talker users who've accumulated a large amount of login time. Such "
"spods tend to be very knowledgeable about talkers and talker coding, as "
"well as more general hacker activites. An unusually high proportion of "
"spods work in the ISP sector, a profession which allows for lengthy "
"periods of login time and for under-the-desk servers, or \"spodhosts\", "
"upon which talker systems are hosted. Compare :ref:`newbie`\\, "
":ref:`tourist`\\, :ref:`weenie`\\, :ref:`twink`\\, :ref:`terminal-"
"junkie`\\, :ref:`warez-d00dz`\\."
