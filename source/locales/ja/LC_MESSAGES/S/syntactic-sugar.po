"[coined by Peter Landin] Features added to a language or other formalism "
"to make it ‘sweeter’ for humans, but which do not affect the "
"expressiveness of the formalism (compare :ref:`chrome`\\). Used esp. when"
" there is an obvious and trivial translation of the ‘sugar’ feature into "
"other constructs already present in the notation. C's :code:`a[i]` "
"notation is syntactic sugar for :manpage:`\\*(a + i)`\\. \"Syntactic "
"sugar causes cancer of the semicolon.\" — Alan Perlis."

"The variants syntactic saccharin and syntactic syrup are also recorded. "
"These denote something even more gratuitous, in that syntactic sugar "
"serves a purpose (making something more acceptable to humans), but "
"syntactic saccharin or syrup serve no purpose at all. Compare "
":ref:`candygrammar`\\, :ref:`syntactic-salt`\\."
