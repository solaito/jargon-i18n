"[abbrev, from Set Priority Level] The way traditional Unix kernels "
"implement mutual exclusion by running code at high interrupt levels. Used"
" in jargon to describe the act of tuning in or tuning out ordinary "
"communication. Classically, spl levels run from 1 to 7; \"Fred's at spl 6"
" today\" would mean that he is very hard to interrupt. \"Wait till I "
"finish this; I'll spl down then.\" See also :ref:`interrupts-locked-"
"out`\\."
