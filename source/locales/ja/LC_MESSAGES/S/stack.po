"The set of things a person has to do in the future. One speaks of the "
"next project to be attacked as having risen to the top of the stack. "
"\"I'm afraid I've got real work to do, so this'll have to be pushed way "
"down on my stack.\" \"I haven't done it yet because every time I pop my "
"stack something new gets pushed.\" If you are interrupted several times "
"in the middle of a conversation, \"My stack overflowed\" means \"I forget"
" what we were talking about.\" The implication is that more items were "
"pushed onto the stack than could be remembered, so the least recent items"
" were lost. The usual physical example of a stack is to be found in a "
"cafeteria: a pile of plates or trays sitting on a spring in a well, so "
"that when you put one on the top they all sink down, and when you take "
"one off the top the rest spring up a bit. See also :ref:`push` and "
":ref:`pop`\\."
