"A prolific programmer; one who can code exceedingly well and quickly. Not"
" all hackers are superprogrammers, but many are. (Productivity can vary "
"from one programmer to another by three orders of magnitude. For example,"
" one programmer might be able to write an average of 3 lines of working "
"code in one day, while another, with the proper tools, might be able to "
"write 3,000. This range is astonishing; it is matched in very few other "
"areas of human endeavor.) The term superprogrammer is more commonly used "
"within such places as IBM than in the hacker community. It tends to "
"stress naive measures of productivity and to underweight creativity, "
"ingenuity, and getting the job *done* â€” and to sidestep the question of "
"whether the 3,000 lines of code do more or less useful work than three "
"lines that do the :ref:`Right-Thing`\\. Hackers tend to prefer the terms "
":ref:`hacker` and :ref:`wizard`\\."
