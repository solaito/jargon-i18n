"[portmanteau of ‘spam’ or ‘spew’ and ‘forgery’. Massive floods of forged "
"articles intended to disrupt a newsgroup. Typically these have "
"reasonable-looking headers but complete gibberish for content, making the"
" legitimate articles too difficult to find. This tactic has been most "
"notoriously used by the Church of Scientology to disrupt discussion on "
"the newsgroup :samp:`alt.religion.scientology`\\, but is unfortunately "
"not by any means confined to that group."
