"[scientific computing] Said of a sequence of memory reads and writes to "
"addresses, each of which is separated from the last by a constant "
"interval called the stride length. These can be a worst-case access "
"pattern for the standard memory-caching schemes when the stride length is"
" a multiple of the cache line size. Strided references are often "
"generated by loops through an array, and (if your data is large enough "
"that access-time is significant) it can be worthwhile to tune for better "
"locality by inverting double loops or by partially unrolling the outer "
"loop of a loop nest. This usage is borderline techspeak; the related term"
" memory stride is definitely techspeak."
