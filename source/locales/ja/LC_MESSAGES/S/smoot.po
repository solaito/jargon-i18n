"[MIT] A unit of length equal five feet seven inches. The length of the "
"Harvard Bridge in Boston is famously 364.4 smoots plus an ear (the ear is"
" allegedly the width of the earhole in the side of the football helmet "
"the victim was wearing when he was rolled over the bridge). This legend "
"began with a fraternity prank in 1958 during which the body length of "
"Oliver Smoot (class of '62) was actually used to measure out that "
"distance. It is commemorated by smoot marks that MIT students repaint "
"every few years; the tradition even survived the demolition and "
"rebuilding of the bridge in the late 1980s. The Boston police have been "
"known to use smoot markers to indicate accident locations on the bridge. "
"Apparently Smoot's experience as a unit of measurement led to a life-long"
" career; he eventually became Chairman of the Board of the American "
"National Standards Institute, and later President of the International "
"Organization for Standardization."
