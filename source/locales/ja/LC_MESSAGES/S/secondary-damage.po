"When a fatal error occurs (esp. a :ref:`segfault`\\) the immediate cause "
"may be that a pointer has been trashed due to a previous :ref:`fandango-"
"on-core`\\. However, this fandango may have been due to an *earlier* "
"fandango, so no amount of analysis will reveal (directly) how the damage "
"occurred. \"The data structure was clobbered, but it was secondary "
"damage.\" By extension, the corruption resulting from ``N`` cascaded "
"fandangoes on core is ‘``N``\\th-level damage’. There is at least one "
"case on record in which 17 hours of :ref:`grovel`\\ling with :code:`adb` "
"actually dug up the underlying bug behind an instance of seventh-level "
"damage! The hacker who accomplished this near-superhuman feat was "
"presented with an award by his fellows."
