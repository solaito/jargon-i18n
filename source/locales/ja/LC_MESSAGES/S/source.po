"[very common] In reference to software, source is invariably shorthand "
"for ‘source code’, the preferred human-readable and human-modifiable form"
" of the program. This is as opposed to object code, the derived binary "
"executable form of a program. This shorthand readily takes derivative "
"forms; one may speak of \"the sources of a system\" or of \"having "
"source\"."
