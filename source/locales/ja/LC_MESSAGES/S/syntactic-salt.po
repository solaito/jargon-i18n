"The opposite of :ref:`syntactic-sugar`\\, a feature designed to make it "
"harder to write bad code. Specifically, syntactic salt is a hoop the "
"programmer must jump through just to prove that he knows what's going on,"
" rather than to express a program action. Some programmers consider "
"required type declarations to be syntactic salt. A requirement to write "
":code:`end if`\\, :code:`end while`\\, :code:`end do`\\, etc. : to "
"terminate the last block controlled by a control construct (as opposed to"
" just :code:`end`\\) would definitely be syntactic salt. Syntactic salt "
"is like the real thing in that it tends to raise hackers' blood pressures"
" in an unhealthy way. Compare :ref:`candygrammar`\\."
