"The act of checking a piece of code (or anything else, e.g., a Usenet "
"posting) for completely stupid mistakes. Implies that the check is to "
"make sure the author was sane when it was written; e.g., if a piece of "
"scientific software relied on a particular formula and was giving "
"unexpected results, one might first look at the nesting of parentheses or"
" the coding of the formula, as a sanity check, before looking at the more"
" complex I/O or data structure manipulation routines, much less the "
"algorithm itself. Compare :ref:`reality-check`\\."

"Conversationally, saying \"sanity check\" means you are requesting a "
