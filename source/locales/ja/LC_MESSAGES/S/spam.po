"To cause a newsgroup to be flooded with irrelevant or inappropriate "
"messages. You can spam a newsgroup with as little as one well- (or ill-) "
"planned message (e.g. asking \"What do you think of abortion?\" on "
":samp:`soc.women`\\). This is often done with :ref:`cross-post`\\ing "
"(e.g. any message which is cross-posted to :samp:`alt.rush-limbaugh` and "
":samp:`alt.politics.homosexuality` will almost inevitably spam both "
"groups). This overlaps with :ref:`troll` behavior; the latter more "
"specific term has become more common."

"To send many identical or nearly-identical messages separately to a large"
" number of Usenet newsgroups. This is more specifically called ECP, "
"Excessive Cross-Posting. This is one sure way to infuriate nearly "
"everyone on the Net. See also :ref:`velveeta` and :ref:`jello`\\."

"To bombard a newsgroup with multiple copies of a message. This is more "

"To mass-mail unrequested identical or nearly-identical email messages, "
"particularly those containing advertising. Especially used when the mail "
"addresses have been culled from network traffic or databases without the "
"consent of the recipients. Synonyms include :ref:`UCE`\\, :ref:`UBE`\\. "
"As a noun, ‘spam’ refers to the messages so sent."

"Any large, annoying, quantity of output. For instance, someone on IRC who"

"The later definitions have become much more prevalent as the Internet has"
" opened up to non-techies, and to most people senses 3 4 and 5 are now "
"primary. All three behaviors are considered abuse of the net, and are "
"almost universally grounds for termination of the originator's email "
"account or network connection. In these senses the term ‘spam’ has gone "
"mainstream, though without its original sense or folkloric freight — "
"there is apparently a widespread myth among :ref:`luser`\\s that "
"\"spamming\" is what happens when you dump cans of Spam into a revolving "
"fan. Hormel, the makers of Spam, have published a surprisingly "
"enlightened `position statement <http://www.spam.com/ci/ci_in.htm>`_\\  "
"on the Internet usage."
