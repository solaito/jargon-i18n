"[C programming] To corrupt the execution stack by writing past the end of"
" a local array or other data structure. Code that smashes the stack can "
"cause a return from the routine to jump to a random address, resulting in"
" some of the most insidious data-dependent bugs known to mankind. "
"Variants include trash the stack, :ref:`scribble` the stack, "
":ref:`mangle` the stack; the term \\*\\* :ref:`mung` the stack is not "
"used, as this is never done intentionally. See :ref:`spam`\\; see also "
":ref:`aliasing-bug`\\, :ref:`fandango-on-core`\\, :ref:`memory-leak`\\, "
":ref:`memory-smash`\\, :ref:`precedence-lossage`\\, :ref:`overrun-"
