"[from analog electronics] Used by hackers in a generalization of its "
"technical meaning. ‘Signal’ refers to useful information conveyed by some"
" communications medium, and ‘noise’ to anything else on that medium. "
"Hence a low ratio implies that it is not worth paying attention to the "
"medium in question. Figures for such metaphorical ratios are never given."
" The term is most often applied to :ref:`Usenet` newsgroups during :ref"
":`flame-war`\\s. Compare :ref:`bandwidth`\\. See also :ref:`coefficient-"
"of-X`\\, :ref:`lost-in-the-noise`\\."
