"[Russian, literally \"self publishing\"] The process of disseminating "
"documentation via underground channels. Originally referred to "
"underground duplication and distribution of banned books in the Soviet "
"Union; now refers by obvious extension to any less-than-official "
"promulgation of textual material, esp. rare, obsolete, or never-formally-"
"published computer documentation. Samizdat is obviously much easier when "
"one has access to high-bandwidth networks and high-quality laser "
"printers. Note that samizdat is properly used only with respect to "
"documents which contain needed information (see also :ref:`hacker-"
"ethic`\\) but which are for some reason otherwise unavailable, but *not* "
"in the context of documents which are available through normal channels, "
"for which unauthorized duplication would be unethical copyright "
"violation. See :ref:`Lions-Book` for a historical example."
