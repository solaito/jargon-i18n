"[common among Mac users] :ref:`SCSI` interface hardware is notoriously "
"fickle of temperament. Often, the SCSI bus will fail to work unless the "
"cable order of devices is re-arranged, SCSI termination is added or "
"removed (sometimes double-termination or *no* termination will fix the "
"problem), or particular devices are given particular SCSI IDs. The skills"
" needed to trick the naturally skittish demons of SCSI into working are "
"collectively known as SCSI voodoo. Compare :ref:`magic`\\, :ref:`deep-"

"While ordinary mortals frequently experience near-terminal frustration "
"when attempting to configure SCSI device chains, it is said that a true "
"master of this arcane art can (through rituals involving chicken blood, "
"ground rhino horn, hairs of a virgin, eye of newt, etc.) hook up your "
"personal computer with three scanners, a Zip drive, an IDE hard drive, a "
"home weather station, a Smith-Corona typewriter, and the neighbor's "
"garage door."
