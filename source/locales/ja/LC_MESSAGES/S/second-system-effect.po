"(sometimes, more euphoniously, second-system syndrome) When one is "
"designing the successor to a relatively small, elegant, and successful "
"system, there is a tendency to become grandiose in one's success and "
"design an :ref:`elephantine` feature-laden monstrosity. The term was "
"first used by Fred Brooks in his classic *The Mythical Man-Month: Essays "
"on Software Engineering* (Addison-Wesley, 1975; ISBN 0-201-00650-2). It "
"described the jump from a set of nice, simple operating systems on the "
"IBM 70xx series to OS/360 on the 360 series. A similar effect can also "
"happen in an evolving system; see :ref:`Brookss-Law`\\, :ref:`creeping-"
"elegance`\\, :ref:`creeping-featurism`\\. See also :ref:`Multics`\\, "
":ref:`OS-2`\\, :ref:`X`\\, :ref:`software-bloat`\\."
