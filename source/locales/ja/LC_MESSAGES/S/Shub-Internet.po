"[MUD: from H. P. Lovecraft's evil fictional deity Shub-Niggurath, the "
"Black Goat with a Thousand Young] The harsh personification of the "
"Internet: Beast of a Thousand Processes, Eater of Characters, Avatar of "
"Line Noise, and Imp of Call Waiting; the hideous multi-tendriled entity "
"formed of all the manifold connections of the net. A sect of MUDders "
"worships Shub-Internet, sacrificing objects and praying for good "
"connections. To no avail — its purpose is malign and evil, and it is the "
"cause of all network slowdown. Often heard as in \"Freela casts a tac "
"nuke at Shub-Internet for slowing her down.\" (A forged response often "
"follows along the lines of: \"Shub-Internet gulps down the tac nuke and "
"burps happily.\") Also cursed by users of the Web, FTP and telnet when "
"the network lags. The dread name of Shub-Internet is seldom spoken aloud,"
" as it is said that repeating it three times will cause the being to "
"wake, deep within its lair beneath the Pentagon. Compare :ref:`Random-"
"Number-God`\\."
