"After-sale handholding; something many software vendors promise but few "
"deliver. To hackers, most support people are useless — because by the "
"time a hacker calls support he or she will usually know the software and "
"the relevant manuals better than the support people (sadly, this is *not*"
" a joke or exaggeration). A hacker's idea of ‘support’ is a "
"*têete-à-têete* with the software's designer."
