"Condition, situation. \"What's the state of your latest hack?\" \"It's "
"winning away.\" \"The system tried to read and write the disk "
"simultaneously and got into a totally :ref:`wedged` state.\" The standard"
" question \"What's your state?\" means \"What are you doing?\" or \"What "
"are you about to do?\" Typical answers are \"about to gronk out\", or "
"\"hungry\". Another standard question is \"What's the state of the world?"
" \", meaning \"What's new?\" or \"What's going on?\". The more terse and "
"humorous way of asking these questions would be \"State-p?\". Another way"
" of phrasing the first question under sense 1 would be \"state-p latest "
"hack? \"."
