"An optical laser works by bouncing photons back and forth between two "
"mirrors, one totally reflective and one partially reflective. If the "
"lasing material (usually a crystal) has the right properties, photons "
"scattering off the atoms in the crystal will excite cascades of more "
"photons, all in lockstep. Eventually the beam will escape through the "
"partially-reflective mirror. One kind of :ref:`sorcerers-apprentice-mode`"
" involving :ref:`bounce-message`\\s can produce closely analogous "
"results, with a :ref:`cascade` of messages escaping to flood nearby "
"systems. By mid-1993 there had been at least two publicized incidents of "
"this kind."
