"Software EXchange. A technique invented by the blue-green algae hundreds "
"of millions of years ago to speed up their evolution, which had been "
"terribly slow up until then. Today, SEX parties are popular among hackers"
" and others (of course, these are no longer limited to exchanges of "
"genetic software). In general, SEX parties are a :ref:`Good-Thing`\\, but"
" unprotected SEX can propagate a :ref:`virus`\\. See also :ref:`pubic-"
"directory`\\."

"The rather Freudian mnemonic often used for Sign EXtend, a machine "
"instruction found in the :ref:`PDP-11` and many other architectures. The "
"RCA 1802 chip used in the early Elf and SuperElf personal computers had a"
" ‘SEt X register’ SEX instruction, but this seems to have had little "
"folkloric impact. The Data General instruction set also had "
":code:`SEX`\\."

":ref:`DEC`\\'s engineers nearly got a :ref:`PDP-11` assembler that used "
"the :code:`SEX` mnemonic out the door at one time, but (for once) "
"marketing wasn't asleep and forced a change. That wasn't the last time "
"this happened, either. The author of *The Intel 8086 Primer*\\, who was "
"one of the original designers of the 8086, noted that there was "
"originally a :code:`SEX` instruction on that processor, too. He says that"
" Intel management got cold feet and decreed that it be changed, and thus "
"the instruction was renamed :code:`CBW` and :code:`CWD` (depending on "
"what was being extended). Amusingly, the Intel 8048 (the microcontroller "
"used in IBM PC keyboards) is also missing straight :code:`SEX` but has "
"logical-or and logical-and instructions :code:`ORL` and :code:`ANL`\\."

"The Motorola 6809, used in the Radio Shack Color Computer and in U.K.'s "
"‘Dragon 32’ personal computer, actually had an official :code:`SEX` "
"instruction; the 6502 in the Apple II with which it competed did not. "
"British hackers thought this made perfect mythic sense; after all, it was"
" commonly observed, you could (on some theoretical level) have sex with a"
" dragon, but you can't have sex with an apple."
