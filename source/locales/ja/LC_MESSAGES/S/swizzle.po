"To convert external names, array indices, or references within a data "
"structure into address pointers when the data structure is brought into "
"main memory from external storage (also called pointer swizzling); this "
"may be done for speed in chasing references or to simplify code (e.g., by"
" turning lots of name lookups into pointer dereferences). The converse "
"operation is sometimes termed unswizzling. See also :ref:`snap`\\."
