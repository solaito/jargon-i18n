"\"Ninety percent of everything is crud\". Derived from a quote by science"
" fiction author Theodore Sturgeon, who once said, \"Sure, 90% of science "
"fiction is crud. That's because 90% of everything is crud.\" Sturgeon "
"himself called this \"Sturgeon's Revelation\", and it first appeared in "
"the March 1958 issue of *Venture Science Fiction*\\; he gave Sturgeon's "
"Law as \"Nothing is always absolutely so.\" Oddly, when Sturgeon's "
"Revelation is cited, the final word is almost invariably changed to "
"‘crap’. Compare :ref:`Hanlons-Razor`\\, :ref:`Ninety-Ninety-Rule`\\. "
"Though this maxim originated in SF fandom, most hackers recognize it and "
"are all too aware of its truth."
