"[Usenet; poss. from the variety of prosimian called a \"slow loris\". The"
" variant ‘Slowlartus’ is also common, related to :ref:`LART`\\] Common "
"hackish term for Solaris, Sun's System VR4 version of Unix that came out "
"of the standardization wars of the early 1990s. So named because "
"especially on older hardware, responsiveness was much less crisp than "
"under the preceding SunOS. Early releases of Solaris (that is, Solaris 2,"
" as some :ref:`marketroid`\\s at Sun retroactively rechristened SunOS as "
"Solaris 1) were quite buggy, and Sun was forced by customer demand to "
"support SunOS for quite some time. Newer versions are acknowledged to be "
"among the best commercial Unix variants in 1998, but still lose single-"
"processor benchmarks to Sparc :ref:`Linux`\\. Compare :ref:`HP-SUX`\\, "
":ref:`sun-stools`\\."
