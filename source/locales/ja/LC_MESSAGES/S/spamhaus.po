"The most notorious of the spamhausen was Sanford Wallace's Cyber "
"Promotions Inc., shut down by a lawsuit on 16 October 1997. The "
"anniversary of the shutdown is celebrated on Usenet as Spam Freedom Day, "
"but lesser imitators of the Spamford still infest various murky corners "
"of the net. Since prosecution of spammers became routine under the junk-"
"fax laws and statues specifically targeting spam, spamhausen have "
"declined in relative importance; today, hit-and-run attacks by spammers "
"using :ref:`relay-rape` and :ref:`throwaway-account`\\s on reputable ISPs"
" seem to account for most of the flow."
