"Marketing deceptions. The term is mainstream in this general sense. Among"
" hackers it's strongly associated with bogus demos and crocked "
":ref:`benchmark`\\s (see also :ref:`MIPS`\\, :ref:`machoflops`\\). \"They"
" claim their new box cranks 50 MIPS for under $5000, but didn't specify "
"the instruction mix — sounds like smoke and mirrors to me.\" The phrase, "
"popularized by newspaper columnist Jimmy Breslin c.1975, has been said to"
" derive from carnie slang for magic acts and ‘freak show’ displays that "
"depend on *trompe l'oeil* effects, but also calls to mind the fierce "
"Aztec god Tezcatlipoca (lit. \"Smoking Mirror\") for whom the hearts of "
"huge numbers of human sacrificial victims were regularly cut out. Upon "
"hearing about a rigged demo or yet another round of fantasy-based "
"marketing promises, hackers often feel analogously disheartened. See also"
" :ref:`stealth-manager`\\."
