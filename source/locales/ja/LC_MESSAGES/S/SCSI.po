"[Small Computer System Interface] A bus-independent standard for system-"
"level interfacing between a computer and intelligent devices. Typically "
"annotated in literature with ‘sexy’ (/sek´see/), ‘sissy’ (/sis´ee/), and "
"‘scuzzy’ (/skuh´zee/) as pronunciation guides — the last being the "
"overwhelmingly predominant form, much to the dismay of the designers and "
"their marketing people. One can usually assume that a person who "
"pronounces it /S-C-S-I/ is clueless."
