"[MIT: from the Schroedinger's Cat thought-experiment in quantum physics] "
"A design or implementation bug in a program that doesn't manifest until "
"someone reading source or using the program in an unusual way notices "
"that it never should have worked, at which point the program promptly "
"stops working for everybody until fixed. Though (like :ref:`bit-rot`\\) "
"this sounds impossible, it happens; some programs have harbored latent "
"schroedinbugs for years. Compare :ref:`heisenbug`\\, :ref:`Bohr-bug`\\, "
":ref:`mandelbug`\\."
