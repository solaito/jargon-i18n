"[Internet and Usenet; often written ‘.sig’ there] Short for ‘signature’, "
"used specifically to refer to the electronic signature block that most "
"Unix mail- and news-posting software will :ref:`automagically` append to "
"outgoing mail and news. The composition of one's sig can be quite an art "
"form, including an ASCII logo, one's choice of witty sayings (see :ref"
":`sig-quote`\\, :ref:`fool-file`\\), or even source code for small "
"programs about which the author wishes to make a statement; but many "
"consider large sigs a waste of :ref:`bandwidth`\\, and it has been "
"observed that the size of one's sig block is usually inversely "
"proportional to one's longevity and level of prestige on the net. See "
"also :ref:`doubled-sig`\\, :ref:`McQuary-limit`\\."
