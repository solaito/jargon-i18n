"A parasitic :ref:`meme` embedded in a :ref:`sig-block`\\. There was a "
":ref:`meme-plague` or fad for these on Usenet in late 1991. Most were "
"equivalents of \"I am a .sig virus. Please reproduce me in your .sig "
"block.\". Of course, the .sig virus's memetic hook is the giggle value of"
" going along with the gag; this, however, was a self-limiting phenomenon "
"as more and more people picked up on the idea. There were creative "
"variants on it; some people stuck ‘sig virus antibody’ texts in their "
"sigs, and there was at least one instance of a sig virus eater."
