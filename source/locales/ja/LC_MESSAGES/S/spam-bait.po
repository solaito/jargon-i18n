"Email addresses included in, or comprising the entirety of, a Usenet "
"message so that spammers mining a newsgroup with an :ref:`address-"
"harvester` will collect them. These addresses can be people who have "
"offended or annoyed the poster, or who are included so that a spammer "
"will spam an official, thereby causing himself trouble. One particularly "
