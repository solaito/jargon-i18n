"[from the :samp:`soc.motss` newsgroup on Usenet, after some obnoxiously "
"gooey cartoon characters] A newsgroup regular with a habitual style that "
"is irreverent, silly, and *cute*\\. Like many other hackish terms for "
"people, this one may be praise or insult depending on who uses it. In "
"general, being referred to as a smurf is probably not going to make your "
"day unless you've previously adopted the label yourself in a spirit of "
"irony. Compare :ref:`old-fart`\\."

"[techspeak] A ping packet with a forged source address sent to some other"
" network's broadcast address. All the machines on the destination network"
" will send a ping response to the forged source address (the victim). "
"This both overloads the victim's network and hides the location of the "
"attacker."
