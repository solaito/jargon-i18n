"(also common as a prefix in combining forms) A Special Interest Group, in"
" one of several technical areas, sponsored by the Association for "
"Computing Machinery; well-known ones include SIGPLAN (the Special "
"Interest Group on Programming Languages), SIGARCH (the Special Interest "
"Group for Computer Architecture) and SIGGRAPH (the Special Interest Group"
" for Computer Graphics). Hackers, not surprisingly, like to overextend "
"this naming convention to less formal associations like SIGBEER (at ACM "
"conferences) and SIGFOOD (at University of Illinois)."
