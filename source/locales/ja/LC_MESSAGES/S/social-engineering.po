"Term used among :ref:`cracker`\\s and :ref:`samurai` for cracking "
"techniques that rely on weaknesses in :ref:`wetware` rather than "
"software; the aim is to trick people into revealing passwords or other "
"information that compromises a target system's security. Classic scams "
"include phoning up a mark who has the required information and posing as "
"a field service tech or a fellow employee with an urgent access problem. "
"See also the :ref:`tiger-team` story in the :ref:`patch` entry, and :ref"
