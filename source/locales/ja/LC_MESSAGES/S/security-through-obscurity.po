"(alt. : security by obscurity) A term applied by hackers to most OS "
"vendors' favorite way of coping with security holes — namely, ignoring "
"them, documenting neither any known holes nor the underlying security "
"algorithms, trusting that nobody will find out about them and that people"
" who do find out about them won't exploit them. This \"strategy\" never "
"works for long and occasionally sets the world up for debacles like the "
":ref:`RTM` worm of 1988 (see :ref:`Great-Worm`\\), but once the brief "
"moments of panic created by such events subside most vendors are all too "
"willing to turn over and go back to sleep. After all, actually fixing the"
" bugs would siphon off the resources needed to implement the next user-"
"interface frill on marketing's wish list — and besides, if they started "
"fixing security bugs customers might begin to *expect* it and imagine "
"that their warranties of merchantability gave them some sort of *right* "
"to a system with fewer holes in it than a shotgunned Swiss cheese, and "
"*then* where would we be?"

"Historical note: There are conflicting stories about the origin of this "
"term. It has been claimed that it was first used in the Usenet newsgroup "
":samp:`comp.sys.apollo` during a campaign to get HP/Apollo to fix "
"security problems in its Unix- :ref:`clone` Aegis/DomainOS (they didn't "
"change a thing). :ref:`ITS` fans, on the other hand, say it was coined "
"years earlier in opposition to the incredibly paranoid :ref:`Multics` "
"people down the hall, for whom security was everything. In the ITS "
"culture it referred to (1) the fact that by the time a tourist figured "
"out how to make trouble he'd generally gotten over the urge to make it, "
"because he felt part of the community; and (2) (self-mockingly) the poor "
"coverage of the documentation and obscurity of many commands. One "
"instance of *deliberate* security through obscurity is recorded; the "
"command to allow patching the running ITS system (escape escape "
"control-R) echoed as $$^D. If you actually typed alt alt ^D, that set a "
"flag that would prevent patching the system even if you later got it "
"right."
