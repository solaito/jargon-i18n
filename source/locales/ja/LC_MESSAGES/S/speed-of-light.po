"The absolutely fastest a particular algorithm or application could be "
"implemented, given a set of constraints that are assumed to be "
"unchangeable. For example, \"This would take 60 microseconds without any "
"processing whatsoever, so that's the speed of light.\" However, as one "
"brilliant hacker once commented: \"Remember that the speed of light only "
"is constant if you can't redesign the universe.\""
