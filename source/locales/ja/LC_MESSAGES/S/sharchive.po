"[Unix and Usenet; from /bin/sh archive] A :ref:`flatten`\\ed "
"representation of a set of one or more files, with the unique property "
"that it can be unflattened (the original files restored) by feeding it "
"through a standard Unix shell; thus, a sharchive can be distributed to "
"anyone running Unix, and no special unpacking software is required. "
"Sharchives are also intriguing in that they are typically created by "
"shell scripts; the script that produces sharchives is thus a script which"
" produces self-unpacking scripts, which may themselves contain scripts. "
"Sharchives are also commonly referred to as ‘shar files’ after the name "
"of the most common program for generating them."

"The downsides of sharchives are that they are an ideal venue for :ref"
":`Trojan-horse` attacks and that, for recipients not running Unix, no "
"simple un-sharchiving program is possible; sharchives can and do make use"
" of arbitrarily-powerful shell features. For these reasons, this "
"technique has largely fallen out of use since the mid-1990s."
