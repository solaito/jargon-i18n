"The act of capturing data from a system or program by snooping the "
"contents of some display that is not actually intended for data transport"
" or inspection by programs. Around 1980 this term referred to tricks like"
" reading the display memory of a smart terminal through its auxiliary "
"port. Nowadays it often refers to parsing the HTML in generated web pages"
" with programs designed to mine out particular patterns of content. In "
"either guise screen-scraping is an ugly, ad-hoc, last-resort technique "
"that is very likely to break on even minor changes to the format of the "
"data being snooped."
