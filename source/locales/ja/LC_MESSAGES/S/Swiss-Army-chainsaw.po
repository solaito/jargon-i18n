"In early Unix days, a well-known technical paper analogized the lexical "
"analyzer generator :manpage:`lex(1)` to a Swiss-army knife; this was a "
"comment on the remarkable variety of more general uses discovered for a "
"program originally designed as a special-purpose code generator for "
"writing compilers. Two decades later, well-known hacker Henry Spencer "
"described the :ref:`Perl` scripting language as a \"Swiss-Army "
"chainsaw\", intending to convey his evaluation of the language as "
"exceedingly powerful but ugly and noisy and prone to belch noxious fumes."
" This had two results: (1) Perl fans adopted the epithet as a badge of "
"pride, and (2) it entered more general usage to describe software that is"
" highly versatile but distressingly inelegant."
