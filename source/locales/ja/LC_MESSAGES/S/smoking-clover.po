"[ITS] A :ref:`display-hack` originally due to Bill Gosper. Many "
"convergent lines are drawn on a color monitor in such a way that every "
"pixel struck has its color incremented. The lines all have one endpoint "
"in the middle of the screen; the other endpoints are spaced one pixel "
"apart around the perimeter of a large square. The color map is then "
"repeatedly rotated. This results in a striking, rainbow-hued, shimmering "
"four-leaf clover. Gosper joked about keeping it hidden from the FDA (the "
"U.S.'s Food and Drug Administration) lest its hallucinogenic properties "
"cause it to be banned."
