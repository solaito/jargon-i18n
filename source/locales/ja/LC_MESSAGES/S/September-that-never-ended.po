"All time since September 1993. One of the seasonal rhythms of the Usenet "
"used to be the annual September influx of clueless newbies who, lacking "
"any sense of :ref:`netiquette`\\, made a general nuisance of themselves. "
"This coincided with people starting college, getting their first internet"
" accounts, and plunging in without bothering to learn what was "
"acceptable. These relatively small drafts of newbies could be assimilated"
" within a few months. But in September 1993, AOL users became able to "
"post to Usenet, nearly overwhelming the old-timers' capacity to "
"acculturate them; to those who nostalgically recall the period before, "
"this triggered an inexorable decline in the quality of discussions on "
"newsgroups. Syn. eternal September. See also :ref:`AOL-`\\."
