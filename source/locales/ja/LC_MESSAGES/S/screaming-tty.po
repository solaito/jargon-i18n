"[Unix] A terminal line which spews an infinite number of random "
"characters at the operating system. This can happen if the terminal is "
"either disconnected or connected to a powered-off terminal but still "
"enabled for login; misconfiguration, misimplementation, or simple bad "
"luck can start such a terminal screaming. A screaming tty or two can "
"seriously degrade the performance of a vanilla Unix system; the arriving "
"\"characters\" are treated as userid/password pairs and tested as such. "
"The Unix password encryption algorithm is designed to be computationally "
"intensive in order to foil brute-force crack attacks, so although none of"
" the logins succeeds; the overhead of rejecting them all can be "
"substantial."
