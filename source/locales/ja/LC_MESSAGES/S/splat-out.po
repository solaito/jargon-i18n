"[Usenet; syn. disemvowel] To partially obscure a potentially provocative "
"word by substituting :ref:`splat` characters for some of its letters "
"(usually, but not always, the vowels). The purpose is not to make the "
"word unrecognizable but to make it a mention rather than a use, so that "
"no flamewar ensues. Words often splatted out include N\\*z\\* (see :ref"
":`Godwins-Law`\\), k\\*bo\\* (see :ref:`KIBO`\\, sense 2), "
"\\*v\\*l\\*t\\*\\*n (anywhere fundamentalists might be lurking), "
"\\*b\\*rt\\*\\*n, and g\\*n c\\*ntr\\*l. Compare :ref:`UN-asterisk-X`\\."
