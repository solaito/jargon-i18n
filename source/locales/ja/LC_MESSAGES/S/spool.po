"[from early IBM ‘Simultaneous Peripheral Operation On-Line’, but is "
"widely thought to be a :ref:`backronym`\\] To send files to some device "
"or program (a spooler) that queues them up and does something useful with"
" them later. Without qualification, the spooler is the print spooler "
"controlling output of jobs to a printer; but the term has been used in "
"connection with other peripherals (especially plotters and graphics "
"devices) and occasionally even for input devices. See also "
