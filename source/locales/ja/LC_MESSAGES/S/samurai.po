"A hacker who hires out for legal cracking jobs, snooping for factions in "
"corporate political fights, lawyers pursuing privacy-rights and First "
"Amendment cases, and other parties with legitimate reasons to need an "
"electronic locksmith. In 1991, mainstream media reported the existence of"
" a loose-knit culture of samurai that meets electronically on BBS "
"systems, mostly bright teenagers with personal micros; they have modeled "
"themselves explicitly on the historical samurai of Japan and on the \"net"
" cowboys\" of William Gibson's :ref:`cyberpunk` novels. Those interviewed"
" claim to adhere to a rigid ethic of loyalty to their employers and to "
"disdain the vandalism and theft practiced by criminal crackers as beneath"
" them and contrary to the hacker ethic; some quote Miyamoto Musashi's "
"*Book of Five Rings*\\, a classic of historical samurai doctrine, in "
"support of these principles. See also :ref:`sneaker`\\, :ref:`Stupids`\\,"
" :ref:`social-engineering`\\, :ref:`cracker`\\, :ref:`hacker-ethic`\\, "
"and :ref:`dark-side-hacker`\\."
