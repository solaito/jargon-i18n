"As in \"Before testing or reconfiguring, always mount a :ref:`scratch-"
"monkey`\\\", a proverb used to advise caution when dealing with "
"irreplaceable data or devices. Used to refer to any scratch volume hooked"
" to a computer during any risky operation as a replacement for some "
"precious resource or data that might otherwise get trashed."

"This term preserves the memory of Mabel, the Swimming Wonder Monkey, star"
" of a biological research program at the University of Toronto. Mabel was"
" not (so the legend goes) your ordinary monkey; the university had spent "
"years teaching her how to swim, breathing through a regulator, in order "
"to study the effects of different gas mixtures on her physiology. Mabel "
"suffered an untimely demise one day when a :ref:`DEC` :ref:`field-circus`"
" engineer troubleshooting a crash on the program's :ref:`VAX` "
"inadvertently interfered with some custom hardware that was wired to "
"Mabel."

"It is reported that, after calming down an understandably irate customer "
"sufficiently to ascertain the facts of the matter, a DEC troubleshooter "
"called up the :ref:`field-circus` manager responsible and asked him "
"sweetly, \"Can you swim?\" Not all the consequences to humans were so "
"amusing; the sysop of the machine in question was nearly thrown in jail "
"at the behest of certain clueless :ref:`droid`\\s at the local ‘humane’ "
"society. The moral is clear: When in doubt, always mount a scratch "
"monkey. [The actual incident occured in 1979 or 1980. There is a version "
"of this story, complete with reported dialogue between one of the project"
" people and DEC field service, that has been circulating on Internet "
"since 1986. It is hilarious and mythic, but gets some facts wrong. For "
"example, it reports the machine as a :ref:`PDP-11` and alleges that "
"Mabel's demise occurred when DEC :ref:`PM`\\ed the machine. Earlier "
"versions of this entry were based on that story; this one has been "
"corrected from an interview with the hapless sysop. —ESR]"
