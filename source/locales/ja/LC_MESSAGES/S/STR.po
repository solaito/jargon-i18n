"Spot the reference. Used in :ref:`scary-devil-monastery` to mark the "
"witticism one just uttered as a quote from some work of art or "
"literature, the more obscure the better. Those who know where the "
"reference comes from reply in the form \"You are $CHARACTER, and you owe "
"me $ITEM\", where $CHARACTER is a character from the story being "
"referenced and $ITEM is something associated with that character. This "
"acronym is never actually expanded to its proper meaning in the "
"newsgroup; posters instead use obscure expansions, the most common being "
"\"slurp the robot\", leading to comments like \"I pulled my hair out, but"
" couldn't figure out which robot you're slurping\"."
