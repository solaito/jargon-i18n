"A now-legendary device used on MIT LISP machines, which inspired several "
"still-current jargon terms and influenced the design of :ref:`EMACS`\\. "
"It was equipped with no fewer than *seven* shift keys: four keys for :ref"
":`bucky-bits` (‘control’, ‘meta’, ‘hyper’, and ‘super’) and three regular"
" shift keys, called ‘shift’, ‘top’, and ‘front’. Many keys had three "
"symbols on them: a letter and a symbol on the top, and a Greek letter on "
"the front. For example, the ‘L’ key had an ‘L’ and a two-way arrow on the"
" top, and the Greek letter lambda on the front. By pressing this key with"
" the right hand while playing an appropriate ‘chord’ with the left hand "
"on the shift keys, you could get the following results:"

"And of course each of these might also be typed with any combination of "
"the control, meta, hyper, and super keys. On this keyboard, you could "
"type over 8000 different characters! This allowed the user to type very "
"complicated mathematical text, and also to have thousands of single-"
"character commands at his disposal. The keyboard of the Symbolics Lisp "
"machine was a simplified version, lacking Top and Front keys, that could "
"only send about 2000 characters."

"Many hackers were actually willing to memorize the command meanings of "
"that many characters if it reduced typing time (this attitude obviously "
"shaped the interface of EMACS). Other hackers, however, thought having "
"that many bucky bits was overkill, and objected that such a keyboard can "
"require three or four hands to operate. See :ref:`bucky-bits`\\, "
":ref:`cokebottle`\\, :ref:`double-bucky`\\, :ref:`meta-bit`\\, :ref"

"Note: early versions of this entry incorrectly identified the space-cadet"
" keyboard with the Knight keyboard. Though both were designed by Tom "
"Knight, the latter term was properly applied only to a keyboard used for "
"ITS on the PDP-10 and modeled on the Stanford keyboard (as described "
"under :ref:`bucky-bits`\\). The true space-cadet keyboard evolved from "
"the first Knight keyboard."
