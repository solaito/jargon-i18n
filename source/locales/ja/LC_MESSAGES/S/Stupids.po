"Term used by :ref:`samurai` for the :ref:`suit`\\s who employ them; "
"succinctly expresses an attitude at least as common, though usually "
"better disguised, among other subcultures of hackers. There may be "
"intended reference here to an SF story originally published in 1952 but "
"much anthologized since, Mark Clifton's *Star, Bright*\\. In it, a super-"
"genius child classifies humans into a very few ‘Brights’ like herself, a "
"huge majority of ‘Stupids’, and a minority of ‘Tweens’, the merely "
"ordinary geniuses."
