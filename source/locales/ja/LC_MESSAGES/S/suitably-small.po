"[perverted from mathematical jargon] An expression used ironically to "
"characterize unquantifiable behavior that differs from expected or "
"required behavior. For example, suppose a newly created program came up "
"with a correct full-screen display, and one publicly exclaimed: \"It "
"works!\" Then, if the program dumped core on the first mouse click, one "
"might add: \"Well, for suitably small values of ‘works’.\""
