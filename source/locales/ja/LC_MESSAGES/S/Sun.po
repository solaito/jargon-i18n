"Sun Microsystems. Hackers remember that the name was originally an "
"acronym, Stanford University Network. Sun started out around 1980 with "
"some hardware hackers (mainly) from Stanford talking to some software "
"hackers (mainly) from UC Berkeley; Sun's original technology concept "
"married a clever board design based on the Motorola 68000 to :ref:`BSD` "
"Unix. Sun went on to lead the workstation industry through the 1980s, and"
" for years afterwards remained an engineering-driven company and a good "
"place for hackers to work. Though Sun drifted away from its techie "
"origins after 1990 and has since made some strategic moves that "
"disappointed and annoyed many hackers (especially by maintaining "
"proprietary control of Java and rejecting Linux), it's still considered "
"within the family in much the same way :ref:`DEC` was in the 1970s and "
"early 1980s."
