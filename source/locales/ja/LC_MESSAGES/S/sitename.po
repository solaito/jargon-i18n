"[Unix/Internet] The unique electronic name of a computer system, used to "
"identify it in email, Usenet, or other forms of electronic information "
"interchange. The folklore interest of sitenames stems from the creativity"
" and humor they often display. Interpreting a sitename is not unlike "
"interpreting a vanity license plate; one has to mentally unpack it, "
"allowing for mono-case and length restrictions and the lack of "
"whitespace. Hacker tradition deprecates dull, institutional-sounding "
"names in favor of punchy, humorous, and clever coinages (except that it "
"is considered appropriate for the official public gateway machine of an "
"organization to bear the organization's name or acronym). Mythological "
"references, cartoon characters, animal names, and allusions to SF or "
"fantasy literature are probably the most popular sources for sitenames "
"(in roughly descending order). The obligatory comment when discussing "
"these is Harris's Lament: \"All the good ones are taken!\" See also :ref"
":`network-address`\\."
