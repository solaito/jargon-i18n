"A small piece of data inserted in order to achieve a desired memory "
"alignment or other addressing property. For example, the :ref:`PDP-11` "
"Unix linker, in split I&D (instructions and data) mode, inserts a two-"
"byte shim at location 0 in data space so that no data object will have an"
" address of 0 (and be confused with the C null pointer). See also :ref"
":`loose-bytes`\\."

"A type of small transparent image inserted into HTML documents by certain"
" WYSIWYG HTML editors, used to set the spacing of elements meant to have "
"a fixed positioning within a TABLE or DIVision. Hackers who work on the "
"HTML code of such pages afterwards invariably curse these for their "
"crocky dependence on the particular spacing of original image file, the "
"editor that generated them, and the version of the browser used to view "
"them. Worse, they are a poorly designed :ref:`kludge` which the advent of"
" Cascading Style Sheets makes wholly unnecessary; Any fool can plainly "
"see that use of borders, layers and positioned elements is the Right "
"Thing (or would be if adequate support for CSS were more common)."
