"A piece of code, not yet written, whose anticipated length is "
"significantly greater than its complexity. Used to refer to a program "
"that could obviously be written, but is not worth the trouble. Also used "
"ironically to imply that a difficult problem can be easily solved because"
" a program can be written to do it; the irony is that it is very clear "
"that writing such a program will be a great deal of work. \"It's easy to "
"enhance a FORTRAN compiler to compile COBOL as well; it's just a SMOP.\""

"Often used ironically by the intended victim when a suggestion for a "
"program is made which seems easy to the suggester, but is obviously (to "
"the victim) a lot of work. Compare :ref:`minor-detail`\\."
