"[from the nuclear power industry] An emergency-power-off switch (see :ref"
":`Big-Red-Switch`\\), esp. one positioned to be easily hit by evacuating "
"personnel. In general, this is *not* something you :ref:`frob` lightly; "
"these often initiate expensive events (such as Halon dumps) and are "
"installed in a :ref:`dinosaur-pen` for use in case of electrical fire or "
"in case some luckless :ref:`field-servoid` should put 120 volts across "
"himself while :ref:`Easter-egging`\\. (See also :ref:`molly-guard`\\, "
":ref:`TMRC`\\.)"

"\"Scram\" was in origin a backronym for \"Safety Cut Rope Axe Man\" "
"coined by Enrico Fermi himself. The story goes that in the earliest "
"nuclear power experiments the engineers recognized the possibility that "
"the reactor wouldn't behave exactly as predicted by their mathematical "
"models. Accordingly, they made sure that they had mechanisms in place "
"that would rapidly drop the control rods back into the reactor. One "
"mechanism took the form of ‘scram technicians’. These individuals stood "
"next to the ropes or cables that raised and lowered the control rods. "
"Equipped with axes or cable-cutters, these technicians stood ready for "
"the (literal) ‘scram’ command. If necessary, they would cut the cables, "
"and gravity would expeditiously return the control rods to the reactor, "
"thereby averting yet another kind of :ref:`core-dump`\\."

"Modern reactor control rods are held in place with claw-like devices, "
"held closed by current. SCRAM switches are circuit breakers that "
"immediately open the circuit to the rod arms, resulting in the rapid "
"insertion and subsequent bottoming of the control rods."
