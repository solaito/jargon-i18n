"A space-combat simulation game, inspired by E. E. \"Doc\" Smith's "
"*Lensman* books, in which two spaceships duel around a central sun, "
"shooting torpedoes at each other and jumping through hyperspace. This "
"game was first implemented on the PDP-1 at MIT in 1962. In 1968-69, a "
"descendant of the game motivated Ken Thompson to build, in his spare time"
" on a scavenged PDP-7, the operating system that became :ref:`Unix`\\. "
"Less than nine years after that, SPACEWAR was commercialized as one of "
"the first video games; descendants are still :ref:`feep`\\ing in video "
"arcades everywhere."
