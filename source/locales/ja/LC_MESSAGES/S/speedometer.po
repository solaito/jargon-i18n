"A pattern of lights displayed on a linear set of LEDs (today) or nixie "
"tubes (yesterday, on ancient mainframes). The pattern is shifted left "
"every ``N`` times the operating system goes through its :ref:`main-"
"loop`\\. A swiftly moving pattern indicates that the system is mostly "
"idle; the speedometer slows down as the system becomes overloaded. The "
"speedometer on Sun Microsystems hardware bounces back and forth like the "
"eyes on one of the Cylons from the wretched *Battlestar Galactica* TV "
"series."
