"[Unix] A special case of a :ref:`filter` that reads its entire input "
"before writing any output; the canonical example is a sort utility. "
"Unlike most filters, a sponge can conveniently overwrite the input file "
"with the output data stream. If a file system has versioning (as ITS did "
"and VMS does now) the sponge/filter distinction loses its usefulness, "
"because directing filter output would just write a new version. See also "
":ref:`slurp`\\."
