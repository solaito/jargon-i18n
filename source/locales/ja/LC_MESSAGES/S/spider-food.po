"Keywords embedded (usually invisibly) into a web page to attract search "
"engines (spiders). The intended result of including spider food in one's "
"web page is to insure that the page appears high on the list of matching "
"entries to a search engine query. There are right and wrong ways to do "
"this; the right way is a discreet ‘meta keywords’ tag, the wrong way is "
"to embed many repeats of a keyword in comments (and many search engines "
"now detect and ignore the latter)."
