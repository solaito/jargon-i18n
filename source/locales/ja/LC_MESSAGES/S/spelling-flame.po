"[Usenet] A posting ostentatiously correcting a previous article's "
"spelling as a way of casting scorn on the point the article was trying to"
" make, instead of actually responding to that point (compare :ref"
":`dictionary-flame`\\). Of course, people who are more than usually "
"slovenly spellers are prone to think *any* correction is a spelling "
"flame. It's an amusing comment on human nature that spelling flames "
"themselves often contain spelling errors."
