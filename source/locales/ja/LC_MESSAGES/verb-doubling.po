"A standard construction in English is to double a verb and use it as an "
"exclamation, such as \"Bang, bang!\" or \"Quack, quack!\". Most of these "
"are names for noises. Hackers also double verbs as a concise, sometimes "
"sarcastic comment on what the implied subject does. Also, a doubled verb "
"is often used to terminate a conversation, in the process remarking on "
"the current state of affairs or what the speaker intends to do next. "
"Typical examples involve :ref:`win`\\, :ref:`lose`\\, :ref:`hack`\\, "
":ref:`flame`\\, :ref:`barf`\\, :ref:`chomp`\\:"
