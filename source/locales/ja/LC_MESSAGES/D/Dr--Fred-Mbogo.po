"[Stanford] The archetypal man you don't want to see about a problem, esp."
" an incompetent professional; a shyster. \"Do you know a good eye "
"doctor?\" \"Sure, try Mbogo Eye Care and Professional Dry Cleaning.\" The"
" name comes from synergy between :ref:`bogus` and the original Dr. Mbogo,"
" a witch doctor who was Gomez Addams' physician on the old *Addams "
"Family* TV show. Interestingly enough, it turns out that under the rules "
"for Swahili noun classes, ‘m-’ is the characteristic prefix of \"nouns "
"referring to human beings\". As such, \"mbogo\" is quite plausible as a "
"Swahili coinage for a person having the nature of a :ref:`bogon`\\. "
"Actually, \"mbogo\" is indeed a Ki-Swahili word referring to the African "
"Cape Buffalo, *syncerus caffer*\\. It is one of the \"big five\" "
"dangerous African game animals, and many people with bush experience "
"believe it to be the most dangerous of them. Compare :ref:`Bloggs-Family`"
" and :ref:`J--Random-Hacker`\\; see also :ref:`Fred-Foobar` and "
":ref:`fred`\\."
