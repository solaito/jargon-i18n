"The veneration of :ref:`Eris`\\, a.k.a. Discordia; widely popular among "
"hackers. Discordianism was popularized by Robert Shea and Robert Anton "
"Wilson's novel *Illuminatus!* as a sort of self-subverting Dada-Zen for "
"Westerners — it should on no account be taken seriously but is far more "
"serious than most jokes. Consider, for example, the Fifth Commandment of "
"the Pentabarf, from *Principia Discordia*\\: \"A Discordian is Prohibited"
" of Believing What he Reads.\" Discordianism is usually connected with an"
" elaborate conspiracy theory/joke involving millennia-long warfare "
"between the anarcho-surrealist partisans of Eris and a malevolent, "
"authoritarian secret society called the Illuminati. See "
":ref:`Religion<religion>` in Appendix B, :ref:`Church-of-the-"
"SubGenius`\\, and :ref:`ha-ha-only-serious`\\."
