"Said of a machine that has the :ref:`bitty-box` nature; a machine too "
"small to be worth bothering with — sometimes the system you're currently "
"forced to work on. First heard from an MIT hacker working on a CP/M "
"system with 64K, in reference to any 6502 system, then from fans of "
"32-bit architectures about 16-bit machines. \"GNUMACS will never work on "
"that dink machine.\" Probably derived from mainstream ‘dinky’, which "
"isn't sufficiently pejorative. See :ref:`macdink`\\."
