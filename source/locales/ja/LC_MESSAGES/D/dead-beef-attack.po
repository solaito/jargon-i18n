"[cypherpunks list, 1996] An attack on a public-key cryptosystem "
"consisting of publishing a key having the same ID as another key (thus "
"making it possible to spoof a user's identity if recipients aren't "
"careful about verifying keys). In PGP and GPG the key ID is the last "
"eight hex digits of (for RSA keys) the product of two primes. The attack "
"was demonstrated by creating a key whose ID was 0xdeadbeef (see "
":ref:`DEADBEEF`\\)."
