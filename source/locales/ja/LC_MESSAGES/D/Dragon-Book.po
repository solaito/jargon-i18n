"The classic text *Compilers: Principles, Techniques and Tools*\\, by "
"Alfred V. Aho, Ravi Sethi, and Jeffrey D. Ullman (Addison-Wesley 1986; "
"ISBN 0-201-10088-6), so called because of the cover design featuring a "
"dragon labeled ‘complexity of compiler design’ and a knight bearing the "
"lance ‘LALR parser generator’ among his other trappings. This one is more"
" specifically known as the ‘Red Dragon Book’ (1986); an earlier edition, "
"sans Sethi and titled *Principles Of Compiler Design* (Alfred V. Aho and "
"Jeffrey D. Ullman; Addison-Wesley, 1977; ISBN 0-201-00022-9), was the "
"\\`‘reen Dragon Book’ (1977). (Also New Dragon Book, Old Dragon Book.) "
"The horsed knight and the Green Dragon were warily eying each other at a "
"distance; now the knight is typing (wearing gauntlets!) at a terminal "
"showing a video-game representation of the Red Dragon's head while the "
"rest of the beast extends back in normal space. See also :ref:`book-"
"titles`\\."
