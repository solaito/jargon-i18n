"A condition endemic to some now-obsolete computers and peripherals "
"(including ASR-33 teletypes and PRIME minicomputers) that results in all "
"characters having their high (0x80) bit forced on. This of course makes "
"transporting files to other systems much more difficult, not to mention "
"the problems these machines have talking with true 8-bit devices."

"This term was originally used specifically of PRIME (a.k.a. PR1ME) "
"minicomputers. Folklore has it that PRIME adopted the reversed-8-bit "
"convention in order to save 25 cents per serial line per machine; PRIME "
"old-timers, on the other hand, claim they inherited the disease from "
"Honeywell via customer NASA's compatibility requirements and struggled "
"heroically to cure it. Whoever was responsible, this probably qualifies "
"as one of the most :ref:`cretinous` design tradeoffs ever made. See :ref"
":`meta-bit`\\."
