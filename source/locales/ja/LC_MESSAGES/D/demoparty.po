"[ :ref:`demoscene`\\] Aboveground descendant of the :ref:`copyparty`\\, "
"with emphasis shifted away from software piracy and towards "
":ref:`compo`\\s. Smaller demoparties, for 100 persons or less, are held "
"quite often, sometimes even once a month, and usually last for one to two"
" days. On the other end of the scale, huge demo parties are held once a "
"year (and four of these have grown very large and occur annually â€” "
"Assembly in Finland, The Party in Denmark, The Gathering in Norway, and "
"NAID somewhere in north America). These parties usually last for three to"
" five days, have room for 3000-5000 people, and have a party network with"
" connection to the internet."
