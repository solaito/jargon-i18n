"A magazine that many hackers assume all :ref:`suit`\\s read. Used to "
"question an unbelieved quote, as in \"Did you read that in "
"*Datamation?*\\\". It used to publish something hackishly funny every "
"once in a while, like the original paper on :ref:`COME-FROM` in 1973, and"
" Ed Post's *Real Programmers Don't Use Pascal* ten years later, but for a"
" long time after that it was much more exclusively :ref:`suit`\\-oriented"
" and boring. Following a change of editorship in 1994, Datamation briefly"
" tried for more the technical content and irreverent humor that marked "
"its early days, but this did not last."
