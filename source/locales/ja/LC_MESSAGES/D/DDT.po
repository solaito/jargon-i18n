"Generic term for a program that assists in debugging other programs by "
"showing individual machine instructions in a readable symbolic form and "
"letting the user change them. In this sense the term DDT is now archaic, "
"having been widely displaced by debugger or names of individual programs "
"like :code:`adb`\\, :code:`sdb`\\, :code:`dbx`\\, or :code:`gdb`\\."

"[ITS] Under MIT's fabled :ref:`ITS` operating system, DDT (running under "
"the alias HACTRN, a six-letterism for ‘Hack Translator’) was also used as"
" the :ref:`shell` or top level command language used to execute other "
"programs."

"Any one of several specific DDTs (sense 1) supported on early :ref:`DEC` "
"hardware and CP/M. The PDP-10 Reference Handbook (1969) contained a "
"footnote on the first page of the documentation for DDT that illuminates "
"the origin of the term:"

"(The ‘tape’ referred to was, incidentally, not magnetic but paper.) "
"Sadly, this quotation was removed from later editions of the handbook "
"after the :ref:`suit`\\s took over and :ref:`DEC` became much more "
"‘businesslike’."

"The history above is known to many old-time hackers. But there's more: "
"Peter Samson, compiler of the original :ref:`TMRC` lexicon, reports that "
"he named DDT after a similar tool on the TX-0 computer, the direct "
"ancestor of the PDP-1 built at MIT's Lincoln Lab in 1957. The debugger on"
" that ground-breaking machine rejoiced in the name FLIT (FLexowriter "
"Interrogation Tape). Flit was for many years the trade-name of a popular "
"insecticide."
