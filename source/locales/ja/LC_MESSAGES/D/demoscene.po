"[also ‘demo scene’] A culture of multimedia hackers located primarily in "
"Scandinavia and northern Europe. Demoscene folklore recounts that when "
"old-time :ref:`warez-d00dz` cracked some piece of software they often "
"added an advertisement in the beginning, usually containing colorful :ref"
":`display-hack`\\s with greetings to other cracking groups. The demoscene"
" was born among people who decided building these display hacks is more "
"interesting than hacking — or anyway safer. Around 1990 there began to be"
" very serious police pressure on cracking groups, including raids with "
"SWAT teams crashing into bedrooms to confiscate computers. Whether in "
"response to this or for esthetic reasons, crackers of that period began "
"to build self-contained display hacks of considerable elaboration and "
"beauty (within the culture such a hack is called a :ref:`demo`\\). As "
"more of these :ref:`demogroup`\\s emerged, they started to have "
":ref:`compo`\\s at copying parties (see :ref:`copyparty`\\), which later "
"evolved to standalone events (see :ref:`demoparty`\\). The demoscene has "
"retained some traits from the :ref:`warez-d00dz`\\, including their style"
" of handles and group names and some of their jargon."

"Traditionally demos were written in assembly language, with lots of smart"
" tricks, self-modifying code, undocumented op-codes and the like. Some "
"time around 1995, people started coding demos in C, and a couple of years"
" after that, they also started using Java."

"Ten years on (in 1998-1999), the demoscene is changing as its original "
"platforms (C64, Amiga, Spectrum, Atari ST, IBM PC under DOS) die out and "
"activity shifts towards Windows, Linux, and the Internet. While deeply "
"underground in the past, demoscene is trying to get into the mainstream "
"as accepted art form, and one symptom of this is the commercialization of"
" bigger demoparties. Older demosceners frown at this, but the majority "
"think it's a good direction. Many demosceners end up working in the "
"computer game industry. Demoscene resource pages are available at "
