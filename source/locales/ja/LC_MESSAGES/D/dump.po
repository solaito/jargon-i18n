"An undigested and voluminous mass of information about a problem or the "
"state of a system, especially one routed to the slowest available output "
"device (compare :ref:`core-dump`\\), and most especially one consisting "
"of hex or octal :ref:`runes` describing the byte-by-byte state of memory,"
" mass storage, or some file. In :ref:`elder-days`\\, debugging was "
"generally done by groveling over a dump (see :ref:`grovel`\\); increasing"
" use of high-level languages and interactive debuggers has made such "
"tedium uncommon, and the term dump now has a faintly archaic flavor."
