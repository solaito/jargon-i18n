"A program which repeatedly calls the same telephone number. Demon dialing"
" may be benign (as when a number of communications programs contend for "
"legitimate access to a :ref:`BBS` line) or malign (that is, used as a "
"prank or denial-of-service attack). This term dates from the :ref:`blue-"
"box` days of the 1970s and early 1980s and is now semi-obsolescent among "
":ref:`phreaker`\\s; see :ref:`war-dialer` for its contemporary progeny."
