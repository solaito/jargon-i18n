"[MIT] A program similar to a :ref:`daemon`\\, except that it is not "
"invoked at all, but is instead used by the system to perform various "
"secondary tasks. A typical example would be an accounting program, which "
"keeps track of who is logged in, accumulates load-average statistics, "
"etc. Under ITS, many terminals displayed a list of people logged in, "
"where they were, what they were running, etc., along with some random "
"picture (such as a unicorn, Snoopy, or the Enterprise), which was "
"generated by the ‘name dragon’. Usage: rare outside MIT — under Unix and "
"most other OSes this would be called a background demon or "
":ref:`daemon`\\. The best-known Unix example of a dragon is "
":manpage:`cron(1)`\\. At SAIL, they called this sort of thing a phantom."
