"[Usenet] Said of a person whose account on a computer has been removed, "
"esp. for cause rather than through normal attrition. \"He got disusered "
"when they found out he'd been cracking through the school's Internet "
"access.\" The verbal form disuser is live but less common. Both usages "
"probably derive from the DISUSER account status flag on VMS; setting it "
"disables the account. Compare :ref:`star-out`\\."
