"[common] A construction used to imbue the subject with campy menace, "
"usually with intent to ridicule. The ancestor of this term is a famous "
"*Far Side* cartoon from the 1980s in which a balloon with a fierce face "
"painted on it is passed off as the \"Floating Head of Death\". Hackers "
"and SF fans have been using the suffix \"of Death\" ever since to label "
"things which appear to be vastly threatening but will actually pop like a"
" balloon if you prick them. Such constructions are properly spoken in a "
"tone of over-exagerrated portentiousness: \"Behold! The Spinning - Pizza "
"- of - Death!\" See :ref:`Blue-Screen-of-Death`\\, :ref:`Ping-O--"
"Death`\\, :ref:`Spinning-Pizza-of-Death`\\, :ref:`click-of-death`\\. "
"Compare :ref:`Doom--X-of`\\."
