"[Usenet: prob. fr. mainstream \"puppy pile\"] When many people post "
"unfriendly responses in short order to a single posting, they are "
"sometimes said to \"dogpile\" or \"dogpile on\" the person to whom "
"they're responding. For example, when a religious missionary posts a "
"simplistic appeal to :samp:`alt.atheism`\\, he can expect to be dogpiled."
" It has been suggested that this derives from U.S. football slang for a "
"tackle involving three or more people; among hackers, it seems at least "
"as likely to derive from an ‘autobiographical’ Bugs Bunny cartoon in "
"which a gang of attacking canines actually yells \"Dogpile on the rabbit!"
" \"."
