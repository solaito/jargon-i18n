"Old software (especially applications) which one is obliged to remain "
"compatible with, or to maintain ( :ref:`DP` types call this legacy code, "
"a term hackers consider smarmy and excessively reverent). The term "
"implies that the software in question is a holdover from card-punch days."
" Used esp. when referring to old scientific and :ref:`number-crunching` "
"software, much of which was written in FORTRAN and very poorly documented"
" but is believed to be too expensive to replace. See :ref:`fossil`\\; "
"compare :ref:`crawling-horror`\\."
