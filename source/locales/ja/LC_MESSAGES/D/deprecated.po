"Said of a program or feature that is considered obsolescent and in the "
"process of being phased out, usually in favor of a specified replacement."
" Deprecated features can, unfortunately, linger on for many years. This "
"term appears with distressing frequency in standards documents when the "
"committees writing the documents realize that large amounts of extant "
"(and presumably happily working) code depend on the feature(s) that have "
"passed out of favor. See also :ref:`dusty-deck`\\."
