"Routines that can never be accessed because all calls to them have been "
"removed, or code that cannot be reached because it is guarded by a "
"control structure that provably must always transfer control somewhere "
"else. The presence of dead code may reveal either logical errors due to "
"alterations in the program or significant changes in the assumptions and "
"environment of the program (see also :ref:`software-rot`\\); a good "
"compiler should report dead code so a maintainer can think about what it "
"means. (Sometimes it simply means that an *extremely* defensive "
"programmer has inserted :ref:`can-t-happen` tests which really can't "
"happen â€” yet.) Syn. :ref:`grunge`\\. See also :ref:`dead`\\, and "
":ref:`The Story of Mel'<story-of-mel>`\\."
