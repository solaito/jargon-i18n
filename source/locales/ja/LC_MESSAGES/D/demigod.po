"A hacker with years of experience, a world-wide reputation, and a major "
"role in the development of at least one design, tool, or game used by or "
"known to more than half of the hacker community. To qualify as a genuine "
"demigod, the person must recognizably identify with the hacker community "
"and have helped shape it. Major demigods include Ken Thompson and Dennis "
"Ritchie (co-inventors of :ref:`Unix` and :ref:`C`\\), Richard M. Stallman"
" (inventor of :ref:`EMACS`\\), Larry Wall (inventor of :ref:`Perl`\\), "
"Linus Torvalds (inventor of :ref:`Linux`\\), and most recently James "
"Gosling (inventor of Java, :ref:`NeWS`\\, and :ref:`GOSMACS`\\) and Guido"
" van Rossum (inventor of :ref:`Python`\\). In their hearts of hearts, "
"most hackers dream of someday becoming demigods themselves, and more than"
" one major software project has been driven to completion by the author's"
" veiled hopes of apotheosis. See also :ref:`net-god`\\, :ref:`true-"
"hacker`\\, :ref:`ubergeek`\\. Since 1995 or so this term has been "
"gradually displaced by :ref:`ubergeek`\\."
