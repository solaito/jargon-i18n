"[from Maxwell's Demon, later incorrectly retronymed as ‘Disk And "
"Execution MONitor’] A program that is not invoked explicitly, but lies "
"dormant waiting for some condition(s) to occur. The idea is that the "
"perpetrator of the condition need not be aware that a daemon is lurking "
"(though often a program will commit an action only because it knows that "
"it will implicitly invoke a daemon). For example, under :ref:`ITS`\\, "
"writing a file on the LPT spooler's directory would invoke the spooling "
"daemon, which would then print the file. The advantage is that programs "
"wanting (in this example) files printed need neither compete for access "
"to nor understand any idiosyncrasies of the LPT. They simply enter their "
"implicit requests and let the daemon decide what to do with them. Daemons"
" are usually spawned automatically by the system, and may either live "
"forever or be regenerated at intervals."

"Daemon and :ref:`demon` are often used interchangeably, but seem to have "
"distinct connotations. The term daemon was introduced to computing by "
":ref:`CTSS` people (who pronounced it /dee´mon/) and used it to refer to "
"what ITS called a :ref:`dragon`\\; the prototype was a program called "
"DAEMON that automatically made tape backups of the file system. Although "
"the meaning and the pronunciation have drifted, we think this glossary "
"reflects current (2003) usage."
