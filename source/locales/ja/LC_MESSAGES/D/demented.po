"Yet another term of disgust used to describe a malfunctioning program. "
"The connotation in this case is that the program works as designed, but "
"the design is bad. Said, for example, of a program that generates large "
"numbers of meaningless error messages, implying that it is on the brink "
"of imminent collapse. Compare :ref:`wonky`\\, :ref:`brain-damaged`\\, "
":ref:`bozotic`\\."
