"vi\\. To disappear or dissolve; the image that goes with it is of an "
"object breaking up into raster lines and static and then dissolving. "
"Occasionally used of a person who seems to have suddenly ‘fuzzed out’ "
"mentally rather than physically. Usage: extremely silly, also rare. This "
"verb was actually invented as *fictional* hacker jargon, and adopted in a"
" spirit of irony by real hackers years after the fact."

"structures (including the code itself) are managed in small segments of "
"the program file known as resources; Rez and DeRez are a pair of "
"utilities for compiling and decompiling resource files. Thus, decompiling"
" a resource is derezzing. Usage: very common."
