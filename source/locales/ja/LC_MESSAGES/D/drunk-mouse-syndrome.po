"(also mouse on drugs) A malady exhibited by the mouse pointing device of "
"some computers. The typical symptom is for the mouse cursor on the screen"
" to move in random directions and not in sync with the motion of the "
"actual mouse. Can usually be corrected by unplugging the mouse and "
"plugging it back again. Another recommended fix for optical mice is to "
"rotate your mouse pad 90 degrees."

"At Xerox PARC in the 1970s, most people kept a can of copier cleaner "
"(isopropyl alcohol) at their desks. When the steel ball on the mouse had "
"picked up enough :ref:`cruft` to be unreliable, the mouse was doused in "
"cleaner, which restored it for a while. However, this operation left a "
"fine residue that accelerated the accumulation of cruft, so the dousings "
"became more and more frequent. Finally, the mouse was declared "
"‘alcoholic’ and sent to the clinic to be dried out in a CFC ultrasonic "
"bath."
