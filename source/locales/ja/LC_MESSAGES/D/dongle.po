"[now obs.] A security or :ref:`copy-protection` device for proprietary "
"software consisting of a serialized EPROM and some drivers in a D-25 "
"connector shell, which must be connected to an I/O port of the computer "
"while the program is run. Programs that use a dongle query the port at "
"startup and at programmed intervals thereafter, and terminate if it does "
"not respond with the dongle's programmed validation code. Thus, users can"
" make as many copies of the program as they want but must pay for each "
"dongle. The first sighting of a dongle was in 1984, associated with a "
"software product called PaperClip. The idea was clever, but it was "
"initially a failure, as users disliked tying up a serial port this way. "
"By 1993, dongles would typically pass data through the port and monitor "
"for :ref:`magic` codes (and combinations of status lines) with minimal if"
" any interference with devices further down the line — this innovation "
"was necessary to allow daisy-chained dongles for multiple pieces of "
"software. These devices have become rare as the industry has moved away "
"from copy-protection schemes in general."

"An adaptor cable mating a special edge-type connector on a PCMCIA or on-"
"board Ethernet card to a standard 8p8c Ethernet jack. This usage seems to"
" have surfaced in 1999 and is now dominant. Laptop owners curse these "
"things because they're notoriously easy to lose and the vendors commonly "
"charge extortionate prices for replacements."

"[Note: in early 1992, advertising copy from Rainbow Technologies (a "
"manufacturer of dongles) included a claim that the word derived from "
"\"Don Gall\", allegedly the inventor of the device. The company's "
"receptionist will cheerfully tell you that the story is a myth invented "
"for the ad copy. Nevertheless, I expect it to haunt my life as a "
"lexicographer for at least the next ten years. :-( —ESR]"
