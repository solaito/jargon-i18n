"Warren Teitelman originally wrote DWIM to fix his typos and spelling "
"errors, so it was somewhat idiosyncratic to his style, and would often "
"make hash of anyone else's typos if they were stylistically different. "
"Some victims of DWIM thus claimed that the acronym stood for ‘Damn "
"Warren’s Infernal Machine! '."

"In one notorious incident, Warren added a DWIM feature to the command "
"interpreter used at Xerox PARC. One day another hacker there typed "
":code:`delete \\*$` to free up some disk space. (The editor there named "
"backup files by appending :code:`$` to the original file name, so he was "
"trying to delete any backup files left over from old editing sessions.) "
"It happened that there weren't any editor backup files, so DWIM helpfully"
" reported :code:`\\*$ not found, assuming you meant 'delete \\*'.` It "
"then started to delete all the files on the disk! The hacker managed to "
"stop it with a :ref:`Vulcan-nerve-pinch` after only a half dozen or so "
"files were lost."

"The disgruntled victim later said he had been sorely tempted to go to "
"Warren's office, tie Warren down in his chair in front of his "
"workstation, and then type :code:`delete \\*$` twice."

"DWIM is often suggested in jest as a desired feature for a complex "
"program; it is also occasionally described as the single instruction the "
"ideal computer would have. Back when proofs of program correctness were "
"in vogue, there were also jokes about DWIMC (Do What I Mean, Correctly). "
"A related term, more often seen as a verb, is DTRT (Do The Right Thing); "
"see :ref:`Right-Thing`\\."
