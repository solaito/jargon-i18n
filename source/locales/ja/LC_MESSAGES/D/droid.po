"[from android, SF terminology for a humanoid robot of essentially "
"biological (as opposed to mechanical/electronic) construction] A person "
"(esp. a low-level bureaucrat or service-business employee) exhibiting "
"most of the following characteristics: (a) naive trust in the wisdom of "
"the parent organization or ‘the system’; (b) a blind-faith propensity to "
"believe obvious nonsense emitted by authority figures (or computers! ); "
"(c) a rule-governed mentality, one unwilling or unable to look beyond the"
" ‘letter of the law’ in exceptional situations; (d) a paralyzing fear of "
"official reprimand or worse if Procedures are not followed No Matter "
"What; and (e) no interest in doing anything above or beyond the call of a"
" very narrowly-interpreted duty, or in particular in fixing that which is"
" broken; an \"It's not my job, man\" attitude."

"Typical droid positions include supermarket checkout assistant and bank "
"clerk; the syndrome is also endemic in low-level government employees. "
"The implication is that the rules and official procedures constitute "
"software that the droid is executing; problems arise when the software "
"has not been properly debugged. The term droid mentality is also used to "
"describe the mindset behind this behavior. Compare :ref:`suit`\\, "
":ref:`marketroid`\\; see :ref:`suffix-oid`\\."

"In England there is equivalent mainstream slang; a ‘jobsworth’ is an "
"obstructive, rule-following bureaucrat, often of the uniformed or suited "
"variety. Named for the habit of denying a reasonable request by sucking "
"his teeth and saying \"Oh no, guv, sorry I can't help you: that's more "
"than my job's worth\"."
