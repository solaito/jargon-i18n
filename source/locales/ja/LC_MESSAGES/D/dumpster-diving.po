"to extract confidential data, especially security-compromising "
"information (‘dumpster’ is an Americanism for what is elsewhere called a "
"skip). Back in AT&T's monopoly days, before paper shredders became common"
" office equipment, phone phreaks (see :ref:`phreaking`\\) used to "
"organize regular dumpster runs against phone company plants and offices. "
"Discarded and damaged copies of AT&T internal manuals taught them much. "

"and/or consumers of high-tech equipment are located, with the expectation"
" (usually justified) of finding discarded but still-valuable equipment to"
" be nursed back to health in some hacker's den. Experienced dumpster-"
"divers not infrequently accumulate basements full of moldering (but still"
" potentially useful) :ref:`cruft`\\."
