"[common] A reference that doesn't actually lead anywhere (in C and some "
"other languages, a pointer that doesn't actually point at anything "
"valid). Usually this happens because it formerly pointed to something "
"that has moved or disappeared. Used as jargon in a generalization of its "
"techspeak meaning; for example, a local phone number for a person who has"
" since moved to the other coast is a dangling pointer."
