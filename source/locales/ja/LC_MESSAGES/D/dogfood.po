"[Microsoft, Netscape] Interim software used internally for testing. \"To "
"eat one's own dogfood\" (from which the slang noun derives) means to use "
"the software one is developing, as part of one's everyday development "
"environment (the phrase is used outside Microsoft and Netscape). The "
"practice is normal in the Linux community and elsewhere, but the term "
"‘dogfood’ is seldom used as open-source betas tend to be quite tasty and "
"nourishing. The idea is that developers who are using their own software "
"will quickly learn what's missing or broken. Dogfood is typically not "
"even of :ref:`beta` quality."
