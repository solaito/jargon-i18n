"The AT&T corporate logo, which bears an uncanny resemblance to the Death "
"Star in the Star Wars movies. This usage was particularly common among "
"partisans of :ref:`BSD` Unix in the 1980s, who tended to regard the AT&T "
"versions as inferior and AT&T as a bad guy. Copies still circulate of a "
"poster printed by Mt. Xinu showing a starscape with a space fighter "
"labeled 4.2 BSD streaking away from a broken AT&T logo wreathed in "
"flames."

"AT&T's internal magazine, *Focus*\\, uses death star to describe an "
"incorrectly done AT&T logo in which the inner circle in the top left is "
"dark instead of light â€” a frequent result of dark-on-light logo images."

"The IBM DeskStar 75GXP drive series, which suffered manufacturing "
"problems and had an uncanny ability to die after a few months in the "
"field. This drive series single-handedly destroyed IBM's previously very "
"good reputation in the hard disk market, and ended up with IBM selling "
"their hard disk business to Hitachi."
