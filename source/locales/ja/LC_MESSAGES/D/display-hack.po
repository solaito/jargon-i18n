"A program with the same approximate purpose as a kaleidoscope: to make "
"pretty pictures. Famous display hacks include :ref:`munching-squares`\\, "
":ref:`smoking-clover`\\, the BSD Unix :manpage:`rain(6)` program, "
":manpage:`worms(6)` on miscellaneous Unixes, and the :ref:`X` "
":manpage:`kaleid(1)` program. Display hacks can also be implemented by "
"creating text files containing numerous escape sequences for "
"interpretation by a video terminal; one notable example displayed, on any"
" VT100, a Christmas tree with twinkling lights and a toy train circling "
"its base. The :ref:`hack-value` of a display hack is proportional to the "
"esthetic value of the images times the cleverness of the algorithm "
"divided by the size of the code. Syn. :ref:`psychedelicware`\\."
