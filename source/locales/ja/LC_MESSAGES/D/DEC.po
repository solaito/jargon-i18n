"n. Commonly used abbreviation for Digital Equipment Corporation, later "
"deprecated by DEC itself in favor of \"Digital\" and now entirely "
"obsolete following the buyout by Compaq. Before the :ref:`killer-micro` "
"revolution of the late 1980s, hackerdom was closely symbiotic with DEC's "
"pioneering timesharing machines. The first of the group of cultures "
"described by this lexicon nucleated around the PDP-1 (see :ref:`TMRC`\\)."
" Subsequently, the PDP-6, :ref:`PDP-10`\\, :ref:`PDP-20`\\, :ref:`PDP-11`"
" and :ref:`VAX` were all foci of large and important hackerdoms, and DEC "
"machines long dominated the ARPANET and Internet machine population. DEC "
"was the technological leader of the minicomputer era (roughly 1967 to "
"1987), but its failure to embrace microcomputers and Unix early cost it "
"heavily in profits and prestige after :ref:`silicon` got cheap. "
"Nevertheless, the microprocessor design tradition owes a major debt to "
"the :ref:`PDP-11` instruction set, and every one of the major general-"
"purpose microcomputer OSs so far (CP/M, MS-DOS, Unix, OS/2, Windows NT) "
"was either genetically descended from a DEC OS, or incubated on DEC "
"hardware, or both. Accordingly, DEC was for many years still regarded "
"with a certain wry affection even among many hackers too young to have "
"grown up on DEC machines."
