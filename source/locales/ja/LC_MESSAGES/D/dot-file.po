"A file that is not visible by default to normal directory-browsing tools "
"(on Unix, files named with a leading dot are, by convention, not normally"
" presented in directory listings). Many programs define one or more dot "
"files in which startup or configuration information may be optionally "
"recorded; a user can customize the program's behavior by creating the "
"appropriate file in the current or home directory. (Therefore, dot files "
"tend to :ref:`creep` â€” with every nontrivial application program defining"
" at least one, a user's home directory can be filled with scores of dot "
"files, of course without the user's really being aware of it.) See also "
":ref:`profile` (sense 1), :ref:`rc-file`\\."
