"[ :ref:`demoscene`\\] A group of :ref:`demo` (sense 4) composers. Job "
"titles within a group include coders (the ones who write programs), "
"graphicians (the ones who painstakingly pixelate the fine art), musicians"
" (the music composers), :ref:`sysop`\\s, traders/swappers (the ones who "
"do the trading and other PR), and organizers (in larger groups). It is "
"not uncommon for one person to do multiple jobs, but it has been observed"
" that good coders are rarely good composers and vice versa. [How odd. "
"Musical talent seems common among Internet/Unix hackers â€”ESR]"
