"[techspeak] A situation wherein two or more processes are unable to "
"proceed because each is waiting for one of the others to do something. A "
"common example is a program communicating to a server, which may find "
"itself waiting for output from the server before sending anything more to"
" it, while the server is similarly waiting for more input from the "
"controlling program before outputting anything. (It is reported that this"
" particular flavor of deadlock is sometimes called a starvation deadlock,"
" though the term starvation is more properly used for situations where a "
"program can never run simply because it never gets high enough priority. "
"Another common flavor is constipation, in which each process is trying to"
" send stuff to the other but all buffers are full because nobody is "
"reading anything.) See :ref:`deadly-embrace`\\."

"Also used of deadlock-like interactions between humans, as when two "
"people meet in a narrow corridor, and each tries to be polite by moving "
"aside to let the other pass, but they end up swaying from side to side "
"without making any progress because they always move the same way at the "
"same time."
