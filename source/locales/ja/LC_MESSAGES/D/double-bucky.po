"This term originated on the Stanford extended-ASCII keyboard, and was "
"later taken up by users of the :ref:`space-cadet-keyboard` at MIT. A "
"typical MIT comment was that the Stanford :ref:`bucky-bits` (control and "
"meta shifting keys) were nice, but there weren't enough of them; you "
"could type only 512 different characters on a Stanford keyboard. An "
"obvious way to address this was simply to add more shifting keys, and "
"this was eventually done; but a keyboard with that many shifting keys is "
"hard on touch-typists, who don't like to move their hands away from the "
"home position on the keyboard. It was half-seriously suggested that the "
"extra shifting keys be implemented as pedals; typing on such a keyboard "
"would be very much like playing a full pipe organ. This idea is mentioned"
" in a parody of a very fine song by Jeffrey Moss called *Rubber "
"Duckie*\\, which was published in *The Sesame Street Songbook* (Simon and"
" Schuster 1971, ISBN 0-671-21036-X). These lyrics were written on May 27,"
" 1978, in celebration of the Stanford keyboard:"
