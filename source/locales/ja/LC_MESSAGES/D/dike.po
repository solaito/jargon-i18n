"To remove or disable a portion of something, as a wire from a computer or"
" a subroutine from a program. A standard slogan is \"When in doubt, dike "
"it out\". (The implication is that it is usually more effective to attack"
" software problems by reducing complexity than by increasing it.) The "
"word ‘dikes’ is widely used to mean ‘diagonal cutters’, a kind of wire "
"cutter. To ‘dike something out’ means to use such cutters to remove "
"something. Indeed, the TMRC Dictionary defined dike as \"to attack with "
"dikes\". Among hackers this term has been metaphorically extended to "
"informational objects such as sections of code."
