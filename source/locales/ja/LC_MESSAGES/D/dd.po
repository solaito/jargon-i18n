"[Unix: from IBM :ref:`JCL`\\] Equivalent to :ref:`cat` or :ref:`BLT`\\. "
"Originally the name of a Unix copy command with special options suitable "
"for block-oriented devices; it was often used in heavy-handed system "
"maintenance, as in \"Let's :code:`dd` the root partition onto a tape, "
"then use the boot PROM to load it back on to a new disk\". The Unix "
":manpage:`dd(1)` was designed with a weird, distinctly non-Unixy keyword "
"option syntax reminiscent of IBM System/360 JCL (which had an elaborate "
"DD ‘Dataset Definition’ specification for I/O devices); though the "
"command filled a need, the interface design was clearly a prank. The "
"jargon usage is now very rare outside Unix sites and now nearly obsolete "
"even there, as :manpage:`dd(1)` has been :ref:`deprecated` for a long "
"time (though it has no exact replacement). The term has been displaced by"
" :ref:`BLT` or simple English ‘copy’."
