"What among hackers is called a :ref:`display-hack`\\. Classical effects "
"include \"plasma\" (colorful mess), \"keftales\" (``x\\*x+y\\*y`` and "
"other similar patterns, usually combined with color-cycling), realtime "
"fractals, realtime 3d graphics, etc. Historically, demo effects have "
"cheated as much as possible to gain more speed and more complexity, using"
" low-precision math and masses of assembler code and building animation "
"realtime are three common tricks, but use of special hardware to fake "
"effects is a :ref:`Good-Thing` on the demoscene (though this is becoming "
"less common as platforms like the Amiga fade away)."

"you demonstrate a perfectly good prototype to a client. Plagues most "
"often CS students and small businesses, but there is a well-known case "
"involving Bill Gates demonstrating a brand new version of a major "
"operating system."
