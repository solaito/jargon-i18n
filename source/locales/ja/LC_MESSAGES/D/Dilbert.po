"n. Name and title character of a comic strip nationally syndicated in the"
" U.S. and enormously popular among hackers. Dilbert is an archetypical "
"engineer-nerd who works at an anonymous high-technology company; the "
"strips present a lacerating satire of insane working conditions and "
"idiotic :ref:`management` practices all too readily recognized by "
"hackers. Adams, who spent nine years in :ref:`cube` 4S700R at Pacific "
"Bell (not :ref:`DEC` as often reported), often remarks that he has never "
"been able to come up with a fictional management blunder that his "
"correspondents didn't quickly either report to have actually happened or "
"top with a similar but even more bizarre incident. In 1996 Adams "
"distilled his insights into the collective psychology of businesses into "
"an even funnier book, *The Dilbert Principle* (HarperCollins, ISBN "
"0-887-30787-6). See also :ref:`pointy-haired`\\, :ref:`rat-dance`\\."
