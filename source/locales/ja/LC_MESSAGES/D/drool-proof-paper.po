"Documentation that has been obsessively :ref:`dumbed-down`\\, to the "
"point where only a :ref:`cretin` could bear to read it, is said to have "
"succumbed to the ‘drool-proof paper syndrome’ or to have been ‘written on"
" drool-proof paper’. For example, this is an actual quote from Apple's "
"LaserWriter manual: \"Do not expose your LaserWriter to open fire or "
"flame.\" The SGI Indy manual included the line \"[Do not] dangle the "
"mouse by the cord or throw it at coworkers.\""
