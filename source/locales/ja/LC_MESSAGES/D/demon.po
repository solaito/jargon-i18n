"[MIT; now probably obsolete] A portion of a program that is not invoked "
"explicitly, but that lies dormant waiting for some condition(s) to occur."
" See :ref:`daemon`\\. The distinction is that demons are usually "
"processes within a program, while daemons are usually programs running on"
" an operating system."

"Demons in sense 2 are particularly common in AI programs. For example, a "
"knowledge-manipulation program might implement inference rules as demons."
" Whenever a new piece of knowledge was added, various demons would "
"activate (which demons depends on the particular piece of data) and would"
" create additional pieces of knowledge by applying their respective "
"inference rules to the original piece. These new pieces could in turn "
"activate more demons as the inferences filtered down through chains of "
"logic. Meanwhile, the main program could continue with whatever its "
"primary task was."
