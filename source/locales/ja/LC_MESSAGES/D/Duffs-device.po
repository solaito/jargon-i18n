"The most dramatic use yet seen of :ref:`fall-through` in C, invented by "
"Tom Duff when he was at Lucasfilm. Trying to optimize all the "
"instructions he could out of an inner loop that copied data serially onto"
" an output port, he decided to unroll it. He then realized that the "
"unrolled version could be implemented by *interlacing* the structures of "
"a switch and a loop:"

"Shocking though it appears to all who encounter it for the first time, "
"the device is actually perfectly valid, legal C. C's default :ref:`fall-"
"through` in case statements has long been its most controversial single "
"feature; Duff observed that \"This code forms some sort of argument in "
"that debate, but I'm not sure whether it's for or against.\" Duff has "
"discussed the device in detail at `http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/duffs-"
"device.html <http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/duffs-device.html>`_. Note that "
"the omission of postfix :code:`++` from :code:`\\*to` was intentional "
"(though confusing). Duff's device can be used to implement memory copy, "
"but the original aim was to copy values serially into a magic IO "
"register."
