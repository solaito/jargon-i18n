"See :ref:`Moof`\\. The dogcow is a semi-legendary creature that lurks in "
"the depths of the Macintosh Technical Notes Hypercard stack V3.1. The "
"full story of the dogcow is told in technical note #31 (the particular "
"dogcow illustrated is properly named ‘Clarus’). Option-shift-click will "
"cause it to emit a characteristic \"Moof!\" or \"!fooM\" sound.*Getting* "
"to tech note 31 is the hard part; to discover how to do that, one must "
"needs examine the stack script with a hackerly eye. Clue: :ref:`rot13` is"
" involved. A dogcow also appears if you choose ‘Page Setup...’ with a "
"LaserWriter selected and click on the ‘Options’ button. It also lurks in "
"other Mac printer drivers, notably those for the now-discontinued Style "
"Writers. See "
