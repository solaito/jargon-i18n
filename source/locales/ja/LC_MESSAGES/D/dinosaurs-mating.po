"Said to occur when yet another :ref:`big-iron` merger or buyout occurs; "
"originally reflected a perception by hackers that these signal another "
"stage in the long, slow dying of the :ref:`mainframe` industry. In the "
"mainframe industry's glory days of the 1960s, it was ‘IBM and the Seven "
"Dwarfs’: Burroughs, Control Data, General Electric, Honeywell, NCR, RCA, "
"and Univac. RCA and GE sold out early, and it was ‘IBM and the Bunch’ "
"(Burroughs, Univac, NCR, Control Data, and Honeywell) for a while. "
"Honeywell was bought out by Bull; Burroughs merged with Univac to form "
"Unisys (in 1984 — this was when the phrase dinosaurs mating was coined); "
"and in 1991 AT&T absorbed NCR (but spat it back out a few years later). "
"Control Data still exists but is no longer in the mainframe business. In "
"similar wave of dinosaur-matings as the PC business began to consolidate "
"after 1995, Digital Equipment was bought by Compaq which was bought by "
"Hewlett-Packard. More such earth-shaking unions of doomed giants seem "
"inevitable."
