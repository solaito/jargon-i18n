"The hexadecimal word-fill pattern for freshly allocated memory under a "
"number of IBM environments, including the RS/6000. Some modern debugging "
"tools deliberately fill freed memory with this value as a way of "
"converting :ref:`heisenbug`\\s into :ref:`Bohr-bug`\\s. As in \"Your "
"program is DEADBEEF\" (meaning gone, aborted, flushed from memory); if "
"you start from an odd half-word boundary, of course, you have BEEFDEAD. "
"See also the anecdote under :ref:`fool` and :ref:`dead-beef-attack`\\."
