"Words such as ‘mumble’, ‘sigh’, and ‘groan’ are spoken in places where "
"their referent might more naturally be used. It has been suggested that "
"this usage derives from the impossibility of representing such noises on "
"a comm link or in electronic mail, MUDs, and IRC channels (interestingly,"
" the same sorts of constructions have been showing up with increasing "
"frequency in comic strips). Another expression sometimes heard is "
"\"Complain! \", meaning \"I have a complaint!\""
