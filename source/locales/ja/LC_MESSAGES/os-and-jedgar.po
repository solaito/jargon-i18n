"On the ITS system there was a program that allowed you to see what was "
"being printed on someone else's terminal. It spied on the other guy's "
"output by examining the insides of the monitor system. The output spy "
"program was called OS. Throughout the rest of the computer science world "
"(and at IBM too) OS means ‘operating system’, but among old-time ITS "
"hackers it almost always meant ‘output spy’."

"OS could work because ITS purposely had very little in the way of "
"‘protection’ that prevented one user from trespassing on another's areas."
" Fair is fair, however. There was another program that would "
"automatically notify you if anyone started to spy on your output. It "
"worked in exactly the same way, by looking at the insides of the "
"operating system to see if anyone else was looking at the insides that "
"had to do with your output. This ‘counterspy’ program was called JEDGAR "
"(a six-letterism pronounced as two syllables: /jed´gr/), in honor of the "
"former head of the FBI."

"But there's more. JEDGAR would ask the user for ‘license to kill’. If the"
" user said yes, then JEDGAR would actually gun the job of the "
":ref:`luser` who was spying. Unfortunately, people found that this made "
"life too violent, especially when tourists learned about it. One of the "
"systems hackers solved the problem by replacing JEDGAR with another "
"program that only pretended to do its job. It took a long time to do "
"this, because every copy of JEDGAR had to be patched. To this day no one "
"knows how many people never figured out that JEDGAR had been defanged."

"Interestingly, there is still a security module named JEDGAR alive as of "
"late 1999 — in the Unisys MCP for large systems. It is unknown to us "
"whether the name is tribute or independent invention."
