"Pejorative name for some versions of the :ref:`GNU` project "
":ref:`copyleft` or General Public License (GPL), which requires that any "
"tools or :ref:`app`\\s incorporating copylefted code must be source-"
"distributed on the same anti-proprietary terms as GNU stuff. Thus it is "
"alleged that the copyleft ‘infects’ software generated with GNU tools, "
"which may in turn infect other software that reuses any of its code. The "
"Free Software Foundation's official position is that copyright law limits"
" the scope of the GPL to \"programs textually incorporating significant "
"amounts of GNU code\", and that the ‘infection’ is not passed on to third"
" parties unless actual GNU source is transmitted. Nevertheless, "
"widespread suspicion that the :ref:`copyleft` language is ‘boobytrapped’ "
"has caused many developers to avoid using GNU tools and the GPL. Changes "
"in the language of the version 2.0 GPL did not eliminate this problem."
