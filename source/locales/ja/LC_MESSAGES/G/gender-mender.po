"[common] A cable connector shell with either two male or two female "
"connectors on it, used to correct the mismatches that result when some "
":ref:`loser` didn't understand the RS232C specification and the "
"distinction between DTE and DCE. Used esp. for RS-232C parts in either "
"the original D-25 or the IBM PC's bogus D-9 format. Also called gender "
"bender, gender blender, sex changer, and even homosexual adapter; "
"however, there appears to be some confusion as to whether a male "
"homosexual adapter has pins on both sides (is doubly male) or sockets on "
"both sides (connects two males)."
