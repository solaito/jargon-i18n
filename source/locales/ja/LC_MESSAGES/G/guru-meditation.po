"Amiga equivalent of panic in Unix (sometimes just called a guru or guru "
"event). When the system crashes, a cryptic message of the form \"GURU "
"MEDITATION #XXXXXXXX.YYYYYYYY\" may appear, indicating what the problem "
"was. An Amiga guru can figure things out from the numbers. Sometimes a "
":ref:`guru` event must be followed by a :ref:`Vulcan-nerve-pinch`\\."

"This term is (no surprise) an in-joke from the earliest days of the "
"Amiga. An earlier product of the Amiga corporation was a device called a "
"‘Joyboard’ which was basically a plastic board built onto a joystick-like"
" device; it was sold with a skiing game cartridge for the Atari game "
"machine. It is said that whenever the prototype OS crashed, the system "
"programmer responsible would calm down by concentrating on a solution "
"while sitting cross-legged on a Joyboard trying to keep the board in "
"balance. This position resembled that of a meditating guru. Sadly, the "
"joke was removed fairly early on (but there's a well-known patch to "
"restore it in more recent versions)."
