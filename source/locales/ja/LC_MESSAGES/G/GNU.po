"[acronym: ‘GNU’s Not Unix! ', see :ref:`recursive-acronym`\\] A Unix-"
"workalike development effort of the Free Software Foundation headed by "
"Richard Stallman. GNU EMACS and the GNU C compiler, two tools designed "
"for this project, have become very popular in hackerdom and elsewhere. "
"The GNU project was designed partly to proselytize for RMS's position "
"that information is community property and all software source should be "
"shared. One of its slogans is \"Help stamp out software hoarding!\" "
"Though this remains controversial (because it implicitly denies any right"
" of designers to own, assign, and sell the results of their labors), many"
" hackers who disagree with RMS have nevertheless cooperated to produce "
"large amounts of high-quality software for free redistribution under the "
"Free Software Foundation's imprimatur. The GNU project has a web page at "
"`http://www.gnu.org/ <http://www.gnu.org/>`_. See :ref:`EMACS`\\, "
":ref:`copyleft`\\, :ref:`General-Public-Virus`\\, :ref:`Linux`\\."
