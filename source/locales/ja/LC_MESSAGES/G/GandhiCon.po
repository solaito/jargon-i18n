"that partisans of :ref:`open-source` and especially :ref:`Linux` have "

"observe while trying to get corporations and other large institutions to "
"take new ways of doing things seriously:"

"In hacker usage this quote has miscegenated with the U.S military's "
"`DefCon <http://www.fas.org/nuke/guide/usa/c3i/defcon.htm>`_\\  "
"terminology describing ‘defense conditions’ or degrees of war alert. At "
"GandhiCon One, you're being ignored. At GandhiCon Two, opponents are "
"laughing at you and dismissing the idea that you could ever be a threat. "
"At GandhiCon Three, they're fighting you on the merits and/or attempting "
"to discredit you. At GandhiCon Four, you're winning and they are arguing "
"to save face or stave off complete collapse of their position."
