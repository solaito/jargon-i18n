"To produce something according to an algorithm or program or set of "
"rules, or as a (possibly unintended) side effect of the execution of an "
"algorithm or program. The opposite of :ref:`parse`\\. This term retains "
"its mechanistic connotations (though often humorously) when used of human"
" behavior. \"The guy is rational most of the time, but mention nuclear "
"energy around him and he'll generate :ref:`infinite` flamage.\""
