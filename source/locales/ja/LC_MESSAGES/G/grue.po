"[from archaic English verb for shudder, as with fear] The grue was "
"originated in the game :ref:`Zork` (Dave Lebling took the name from Jack "
"Vance's *Dying Earth* fantasies) and used in several other :ref:`Infocom`"
" games as a hint that you should perhaps look for a lamp, torch or some "
"type of light source. Wandering into a dark area would cause the game to "
"prompt you, \"It is very dark. If you continue you are likely to be eaten"
" by a grue.\" If you failed to locate a light source within the next "
"couple of moves this would indeed be the case."

"The grue, according to scholars of the Great Underground Empire, is a "
"sinister, lurking presence in the dark places of the earth. Its favorite "
"diet is either adventurers or enchanters, but its insatiable appetite is "
"tempered by its extreme fear of light. No grues have ever been seen by "
"the light of day, and only a few have been observed in their underground "
"lairs. Of those who have seen grues, few have survived their fearsome "
"jaws to tell the tale. Grues have sickly glowing fur, fish-mouthed faces,"
" sharp claws and fangs, and an uncontrollable tendency to slaver and "
"gurgle. They are certainly the most evil-tempered of all creatures; to "
"say they are touchy is a dangerous understatement. \"Sour as a grue\" is "
"a common expression, even among grues themselves."
