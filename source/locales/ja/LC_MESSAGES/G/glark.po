"To figure something out from context. \"The System III manuals are pretty"
" poor, but you can generally glark the meaning from context.\" "
"Interestingly, the word was originally ‘glork’; the context was \"This "
"gubblick contains many nonsklarkish English flutzpahs, but the overall "
"pluggandisp can be glorked [sic] from context\" (David Moser, quoted by "
"Douglas Hofstadter in his *Metamagical Themas* column in the January 1981"
" *Scientific American*\\). It is conjectured that hacker usage mutated "
"the verb to ‘glark’ because :ref:`glork` was already an established "
"jargon term (some hackers do report using the original term). Compare "
":ref:`grok`\\, :ref:`zen`\\."
