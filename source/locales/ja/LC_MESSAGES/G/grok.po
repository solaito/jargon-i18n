"To understand. Connotes intimate and exhaustive knowledge. When you claim"
" to ‘grok’ some knowledge or technique, you are asserting that you have "
"not merely learned it in a detached instrumental way but that it has "
"become part of you, part of your identity. For example, to say that you "
"\"know\" :ref:`LISP` is simply to assert that you can code in it if "
"necessary — but to say you \"grok\" LISP is to claim that you have deeply"
" entered the world-view and spirit of the language, with the implication "
"that it has transformed your view of programming. Contrast :ref:`zen`\\, "
"which is similar supernal understanding experienced as a single brief "
"flash. See also :ref:`glark`\\."
