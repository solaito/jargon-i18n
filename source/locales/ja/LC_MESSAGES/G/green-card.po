"The original green card became a yellow card when the System/370 was "
"introduced, and later a yellow booklet. An anecdote from IBM refers to a "
"scene that took place in a programmers' terminal room at Yorktown in "
"1978. A :ref:`luser` overheard one of the programmers ask another \"Do "
"you have a green card?\" The other grunted and passed the first a thick "
"yellow booklet. At this point the luser turned a delicate shade of olive "
"and rapidly left the room, never to return."
