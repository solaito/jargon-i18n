"[Usenet] \"As a Usenet discussion grows longer, the probability of a "
"comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches one.\" There is a "
"tradition in many groups that, once this occurs, that thread is over, and"
" whoever mentioned the Nazis has automatically lost whatever argument was"
" in progress. Godwin's Law thus practically guarantees the existence of "
"an upper bound on thread length in those groups. However there is also a "
"widely- recognized codicil that any *intentional* triggering of Godwin's "
"Law in order to invoke its thread-ending effects will be unsuccessful. "
"Godwin himself has `discussed the subject "
"<http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.10/godwin.if_pr.html>`_. See also "
":ref:`Formosas-Law`\\."
