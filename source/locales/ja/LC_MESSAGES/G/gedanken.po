"‘Gedanken’ is a German word for ‘thought’. A thought experiment is one "
"you carry out in your head. In physics, the term *gedanken experiment* is"
" used to refer to an experiment that is impractical to carry out, but "
"useful to consider because it can be reasoned about theoretically. (A "
"classic gedanken experiment of relativity theory involves thinking about "
"a man in an elevator accelerating through space.) Gedanken experiments "
"are very useful in physics, but must be used with care. It's too easy to "
"idealize away some important aspect of the real world in constructing the"
" ‘apparatus’."

"Among hackers, accordingly, the word has a pejorative connotation. It is "
"typically used of a project, especially one in artificial intelligence "
"research, that is written up in grand detail (typically as a Ph.D. "
"thesis) without ever being implemented to any great extent. Such a "
"project is usually perpetrated by people who aren't very good hackers or "
"find programming distasteful or are just in a hurry. A gedanken thesis is"
" usually marked by an obvious lack of intuition about what is "
"programmable and what is not, and about what does and does not constitute"
" a clear specification of an algorithm. See also :ref:`AI-complete`\\, "
":ref:`DWIM`\\."
