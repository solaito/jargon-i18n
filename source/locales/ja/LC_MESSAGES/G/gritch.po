"Interestingly, this word seems to have a separate history from "
":ref:`glitch`\\, with which it is often confused. Back in the early "
"1960s, when ‘glitch’ was strictly a hardware-tech's term of art, the "
"Burton House dorm at M.I.T. maintained a \"Gritch Book\", a blank volume,"
" into which the residents hand-wrote complaints, suggestions, and "
"witticisms. Previous years' volumes of this tradition were maintained, "
"dating back to antiquity. The word \"gritch\" was described as a "
"portmanteau of \"gripe\" and \"bitch\". Thus, sense 3 above is at least "
"historically incorrect."
