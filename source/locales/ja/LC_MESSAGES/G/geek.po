"A person who has chosen concentration rather than conformity; one who "
"pursues skill (especially technical skill) and imagination, not "
"mainstream social acceptance. Geeks usually have a strong case of "
":ref:`neophilia`\\. Most geeks are adept with computers and treat "
":ref:`hacker` as a term of respect, but not all are hackers themselves — "
"and some who *are* in fact hackers normally call themselves geeks anyway,"
" because they (quite properly) regard ‘hacker’ as a label that should be "
"bestowed by others rather than self-assumed."

"accurately if a little breathlessly enumerates \"gamers, ravers, science "
"fiction fans, punks, perverts, programmers, nerds, subgenii, and "
"trekkies. These are people who did not go to their high school proms, and"
" many would be offended by the suggestion that they should have even "

"Originally, a geek was a carnival performer who bit the heads off "
"chickens. (In early 20th-century Scotland a ‘geek’ was an immature coley,"
" a type of fish.) Before about 1990 usage of this term was rather "
"negative. Earlier versions of this lexicon defined a computer geek as one"
" who eats (computer) bugs for a living — an asocial, malodorous, pasty-"
"faced monomaniac with all the personality of a cheese grater. This is "
"often still the way geeks are regarded by non-geeks, but as the "
"mainstream culture becomes more dependent on technology and technical "
"skill mainstream attitudes have tended to shift towards grudging respect."
" Correspondingly, there are now ‘geek pride’ festivals (the implied "
"reference to ‘gay pride’ is not accidental)."
