"where food is served family-style and shared. There is a common heuristic"
" about the amount of food to order, expressed as \"Get ``N - 1`` "
"entrees\"; the value of ``N``\\, which is the number of people in the "
"group, can be inferred from context (see :ref:`N`\\). See :ref:`oriental-"
"food`\\, :ref:`ravs`\\, :ref:`stir-fried-random`\\."
