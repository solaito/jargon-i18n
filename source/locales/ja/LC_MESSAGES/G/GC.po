"Garbage collection is computer-science techspeak for a particular class "
"of strategies for dynamically but transparently reallocating computer "
"memory (i.e., without requiring explicit allocation and deallocation by "
"higher-level software). One such strategy involves periodically scanning "
"all the data in memory and determining what is no longer accessible; "
"useless data items are then discarded so that the memory they occupy can "
"be recycled and used for another purpose. Implementations of the LISP "
"language usually use garbage collection."

"In jargon, the full phrase is sometimes heard but the :ref:`abbrev` GC is"
" more frequently used because it is shorter. Note that there is an "
"ambiguity in usage that has to be resolved by context: \"I'm going to "
"garbage-collect my desk\" usually means to clean out the drawers, but it "
"could also mean to throw away or recycle the desk itself."
