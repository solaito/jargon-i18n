"The side-effect that destroyed touch-screens as a mainstream input "
"technology despite a promising start in the early 1980s. It seems the "
"designers of all those :ref:`spiffy` touch-menu systems failed to notice "
"that humans aren't designed to hold their arms in front of their faces "
"making small motions. After more than a very few selections, the arm "
"begins to feel sore, cramped, and oversized â€” the operator looks like a "
"gorilla while using the touch screen and feels like one afterwards. This "
"is now considered a classic cautionary tale to human-factors designers; "
"\"Remember the gorilla arm!\" is shorthand for \"How is this going to fly"
" in real use? \"."
