"n\\. A sudden interruption in electric service, sanity, continuity, or "
"program function. Sometimes recoverable. An interruption in electric "
"service is specifically called a power glitch (also :ref:`power-hit`\\), "
"of grave concern because it usually crashes all the computers. In jargon,"
" though, a hacker who got to the middle of a sentence and then forgot how"
" he or she intended to complete it might say, \"Sorry, I just glitched\"."

"All these uses of glitch derive from the specific technical meaning the "
"term has in the electronic hardware world, where it is now techspeak. A "
"glitch can occur when the inputs of a circuit change, and the outputs "
"change to some :ref:`random` value for some very brief time before they "
"settle down to the correct value. If another circuit inspects the output "
"at just the wrong time, reading the random value, the results can be very"
" wrong and very hard to debug (a glitch is one of many causes of "
"electronic :ref:`heisenbug`\\s)."
