"The unknown ur-noun, fill in your own meaning. Found esp. on the Usenet "
"newsgroup :samp:`alt.gorets`\\, which seems to be a running contest to "
"redefine the word by implication in the funniest and most peculiar way, "
"with the understanding that no definition is ever final. [A correspondent"
" from the former Soviet Union informs me that *gorets* is Russian for "
"‘mountain dweller’. Another from France informs me that *goret* is "
"archaic French for a young pig —ESR] Compare :ref:`frink`\\."
