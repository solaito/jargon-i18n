"There is a widespread legend (repeated by earlier versions of this entry,"
" though tagged as folklore) that the uppercase-only support of various "
"old character codes and I/O equipment was chosen by a religious person in"
" a position of power at the Teletype Company because supporting both "
"upper and lower cases was too expensive and supporting lower case only "
"would have made it impossible to spell ‘God’ correctly. Not true; the "
"upper-case interpretation of teleprinter codes was well established by "
"1870, long before Teletype was even founded."
