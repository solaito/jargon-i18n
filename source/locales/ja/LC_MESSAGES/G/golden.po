"medium (e.g., golden disk, golden tape), describes one containing a "
"tested, up-to-spec, ready-to-ship software version. Compare :ref"
":`platinum-iridium`\\. One may also \"go gold\", which is the act of "
"releasing a golden version. The gold color of many CDROMs is a "
"coincidence; this term was well established a decade before CDROM "
