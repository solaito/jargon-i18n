"The use of large numbers of loosely coupled programmers in an attempt to "
"wedge a great many features into a product in a short time. Though there "
"have been memorable gang bangs (e.g., that over-the-weekend assembler "
"port mentioned in Steven Levy's *Hackers*\\), and large numbers of "
"loosely-coupled programmers operating in :ref:`bazaar` mode can do very "
"useful work when they're not on a deadline, most are perpetrated by large"
" companies trying to meet unrealistic deadlines; the inevitable result is"
" enormous buggy masses of code entirely lacking in "
":ref:`orthogonal`\\ity. When market-driven managers make a list of all "
"the features the competition has and assign one programmer to implement "
"each, the probability of maintaining a coherent (or even functional) "
"design goes to :ref:`epsilon`\\. See also :ref:`firefighting`\\, :ref"
":`Mongolian-Hordes-technique`\\, :ref:`Conways-Law`\\."
