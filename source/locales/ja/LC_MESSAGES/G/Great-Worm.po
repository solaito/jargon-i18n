"The 1988 Internet :ref:`worm` perpetrated by :ref:`RTM`\\. This is a play"
" on Tolkien (compare :ref:`elvish`\\, :ref:`elder-days`\\). In the "
"fantasy history of his Middle Earth books, there were dragons powerful "
"enough to lay waste to entire regions; two of these (Scatha and Glaurung)"
" were known as \"the Great Worms\". This usage expresses the connotation "
"that the RTM crack was a sort of devastating watershed event in hacker "
"history; certainly it did more to make non-hackers nervous about the "
"Internet than anything before or since."
