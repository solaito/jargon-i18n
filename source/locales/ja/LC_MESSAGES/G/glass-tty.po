"[obs.] A terminal that has a display screen but which, because of "
"hardware or software limitations, behaves like a teletype or some other "
"printing terminal, thereby combining the disadvantages of both: like a "
"printing terminal, it can't do fancy display hacks, and like a display "
"terminal, it doesn't produce hard copy. An example is the early ‘dumb’ "
"version of Lear-Siegler ADM 3 (without cursor control). See "
":ref:`tube`\\, :ref:`tty`\\; compare :ref:`dumb-terminal`\\. See * TV "
"Typewriters* (Appendix A) for an interesting true story about a glass "
"tty."
