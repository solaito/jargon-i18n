"Without qualification, Guido van Rossum (author of :ref:`Python`\\). Note"
" that Guido answers to English /gwee´do/ but in Dutch it's /khwee´do/. "
"Mythically, Guido's most important attribute besides Python itself is "
"Guido's time machine, a device he is reputed to possess because of the "
"unnerving frequency with which user requests for new features have been "
"met with the response \"I just implemented that last night...\". See "
