"The IBM 2741, a slow but letter-quality printing device and terminal "
"based on the IBM Selectric typewriter. The golf ball was a little "
"spherical frob bearing reversed embossed images of 88 different "
"characters arranged on four parallels of latitude; one could change the "
"font by swapping in a different golf ball. The print element spun and "
"jerked alarmingly in action and when in motion was sometimes described as"
" an infuriated golf ball. This was the technology that enabled APL to use"
" a non-EBCDIC, non-ASCII, and in fact completely non-standard character "
"set. This put it 10 years ahead of its time â€” where it stayed, firmly "
"rooted, for the next 20, until character displays gave way to "
"programmable bit-mapped devices with the flexibility to support other "
"character sets."
