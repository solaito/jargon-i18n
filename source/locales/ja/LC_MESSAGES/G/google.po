"[common] To search the Web using the Google search engine, "
"`http://www.google.com <http://www.google.com>`_. Google is highly "
"esteemed among hackers for its significance ranking system, which is so "
"uncannily effective that many hackers consider it to have rendered other "
"search engines effectively irrelevant. The name ‘google’ has additional "
"flavor for hackers because most know that it was copied from a "
"mathematical term for ten to the 100th power, famously first uttered as "
"‘googol’ by a mathematician's nine-year-old nephew."
