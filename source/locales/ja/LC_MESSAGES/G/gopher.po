"[obs.] A type of Internet service first floated around 1991 and "
"obsolesced around 1995 by the World Wide Web. Gopher presents a menuing "
"interface to a tree or graph of links; the links can be to documents, "
"runnable programs, or other gopher menus arbitrarily far across the net."

"Some claim that the gopher software, which was originally developed at "
"the University of Minnesota, was named after the Minnesota Gophers (a "
"sports team). Others claim the word derives from American slang gofer "
"(from \"go for\", dialectal \"go fer\"), one whose job is to run and "
"fetch things. Finally, observe that gophers dig long tunnels, and the "
"idea of tunneling through the net to find information was a defining "
"metaphor for the developers. Probably all three things were true, but "
"with the first two coming first and the gopher-tunnel metaphor "
"serendipitously adding flavor and impetus to the project as it developed "
"out of its concept stage."
