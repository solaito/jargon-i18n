"A mythical accessory to a terminal. A crank on the side of a monitor, "
"which when operated makes a zizzing noise and causes the computer to run "
"faster. Usually one does not refer to a grind crank out loud, but merely "
"makes the appropriate gesture and noise. See :ref:`grind`\\."

"Historical note: At least one real machine actually had a grind crank — "
"the R1, a research machine built toward the end of the days of the great "
"vacuum tube computers, in 1959. R1 (also known as ‘The Rice Institute "
"Computer’ (TRIC) and later as ‘The Rice University Computer’ (TRUC)) had "
"a single-step/free-run switch for use when debugging programs. Since "
"single-stepping through a large program was rather tedious, there was "
"also a crank with a cam and gear arrangement that repeatedly pushed the "
"single-step button. This allowed one to ‘crank’ through a lot of code, "
"then slow down to single-step for a bit when you got near the code of "
"interest, poke at some registers using the console typewriter, and then "
"keep on cranking. See `http://www.cs.rice.edu/History/R1/ "
