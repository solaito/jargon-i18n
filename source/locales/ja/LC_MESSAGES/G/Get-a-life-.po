"Hacker-standard way of suggesting that the person to whom it is directed "
"has succumbed to terminal geekdom (see :ref:`geek`\\). Often heard on "
":ref:`Usenet`\\, esp. as a way of suggesting that the target is taking "
"some obscure issue of :ref:`theology` too seriously. This exhortation was"
" popularized by William Shatner on a 1987 *Saturday Night Live* episode "
"in a speech that ended \"Get a life! \", but it can be traced back at "
"least to ‘Valley Girl’ slang in 1983. It was certainly in wide use among "
"hackers for years before achieving mainstream currency via the sitcom "
"*Get A Life* in 1990."
