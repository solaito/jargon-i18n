"\"Common abbreviation for Goober with Firewall\". A :ref:`luser` who has "
"equipped his desktop computer with a hypersensitive \"software firewall\""
" or host intrusion detection program, and who gives its alerts absolute "
"credence. ISP tech support and abuse desks dread hearing from such "
"persons, who insist that every packet of abnormal traffic the software "
"detects is \"a hacker\" (sic) and, occasionally, threatening lawsuits or "
"prosecution. GWFs have been known to assert that they are being attacked "
"from 127.0.0.1, and that their ISP is criminally negligent for failing to"
" block these attacks. \"GWF\" is used similarly to :ref:`idiot` and "
":ref:`PEBKAC` to flag trouble tickets opened by such users."
