"v\\. To :ref:`hack`\\, usually at night. At WPI, from 1975 onwards, one "
"who gweeped could often be found at the College Computing Center punching"
" cards or crashing the :ref:`PDP-10` or, later, the DEC-20. A "
"correspondent who was there at the time opines that the term was "
"originally onomatopoetic, describing the keyclick sound of the Datapoint "
"terminals long connected to the PDP-10; others allege that ‘gweep’ was "
"the sound of the Datapoint's bell (compare :ref:`feep`\\). The term has "
"survived the demise of those technologies, however, and was still alive "
"in early 1999. \"I'm going to go gweep for a while. See you in the "
"morning.\" \"I gweep from 8 PM till 3 AM during the week.\""

"n\\. One who habitually gweeps in sense 1; a :ref:`hacker`\\. \"He's a "
"hard-core gweep, mumbles code in his sleep.\" Around 1979 this was "
"considered derogatory and not used in self-reference; it has since been "
"proudly claimed in much the same way as :ref:`geek`\\."
