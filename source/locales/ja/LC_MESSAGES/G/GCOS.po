"A :ref:`quick-and-dirty` :ref:`clone` of System/360 DOS that emerged from"
" GE around 1970; originally called GECOS (the General Electric "
"Comprehensive Operating System). Later kluged to support primitive "
"timesharing and transaction processing. After the buyout of GE's computer"
" division by Honeywell, the name was changed to General Comprehensive "
"Operating System (GCOS). Other OS groups at Honeywell began referring to "
"it as ‘God's Chosen Operating System’, allegedly in reaction to the GCOS "
"crowd's uninformed and snotty attitude about the superiority of their "
"product. All this might be of zero interest, except for two facts: (1) "
"The GCOS people won the political war, and this led in the orphaning and "
"eventual death of Honeywell :ref:`Multics`\\, and (2) GECOS/GCOS left one"
" permanent mark on Unix. Some early Unix systems at Bell Labs used GCOS "
"machines for print spooling and various other services; the field added "
"to /etc/passwd to carry GCOS ID information was called the GECOS field "
"and survives today as the :code:`pw_gecos` member used for the user's "
"full name and other human-ID information. GCOS later played a major role "
"in keeping Honeywell a dismal also-ran in the mainframe market, and was "
"itself mostly ditched for Unix in the late 1980s when Honeywell began to "
"retire its aging :ref:`big-iron` designs."
