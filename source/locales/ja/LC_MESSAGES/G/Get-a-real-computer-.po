"In 1996 when this entry first entered the File, it was the typical hacker"
" response to news that somebody is having trouble getting work done on a "
"system that (a) was single-tasking, (b) had no hard disk, or (c) had an "
"address space smaller than 16 megabytes. In 2003 anything less powerful "
"than a 500MHz Pentium with a multi-gigabyte hard disk would probably be "
"similarly written off. The threshold for ‘real computer’ rises with time."
