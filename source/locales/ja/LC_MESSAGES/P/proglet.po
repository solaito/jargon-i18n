"[UK] A short *extempore* program written to meet an immediate, transient "
"need. Often written in BASIC, rarely more than a dozen lines long, and "
"containing no subroutines. The largest amount of code that can be written"
" off the top of one's head, that does not need any editing, and that runs"
" correctly the first time (this amount varies significantly according to "
"one's skill and the language one is using). Compare :ref:`toy-program`\\,"
