"[XEROX PARC] A ‘special effect’ that occurs when certain kinds of :ref"
":`memory-smash`\\es overwrite the control blocks or image memory of a "
"bit-mapped display. The term \"salt and pepper\" may refer to a different"
" pattern of similar origin. Though the term as coined at PARC refers to "
"the result of an error, some of the :ref:`X` demos induce plaid-screen "
"effects deliberately as a :ref:`display-hack`\\."
