"(and :ref:`poke`\\) The commands in most microcomputer BASICs for "
"directly accessing memory contents at an absolute address; often extended"
" to mean the corresponding constructs in any :ref:`HLL` (peek reads "
"memory, poke modifies it). Much hacking on small, non-MMU micros used to "
"consist of peeking around memory, more or less at random, to find the "
"location where the system keeps interesting stuff. Long (and variably "
"accurate) lists of such addresses for various computers circulated. The "
"results of pokes at these addresses may be highly useful, mildly amusing,"
" useless but neat, or (most likely) total :ref:`lossage` (see :ref"
":`killer-poke`\\)."

"Since a :ref:`real-operating-system` provides useful, higher-level "
"services for the tasks commonly performed with peeks and pokes on micros,"
" and real languages tend not to encourage low-level memory groveling, a "
"question like \"How do I do a peek in C?\" is diagnostic of the "
":ref:`newbie`\\. (Of course, OS kernels often have to do exactly this; a "
"real kernel hacker would unhesitatingly, if unportably, assign an "
"absolute address to a pointer variable and indirect through it.)"
