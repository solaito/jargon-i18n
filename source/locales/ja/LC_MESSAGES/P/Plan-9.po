"In the late 1980s, researchers at Bell Labs (especially Rob Pike of "
"Kernighan & Pike fame) got bored with the limitations of UNIX and decided"
" to reimplement the entire system. The result was called Plan 9 in \"the "
"Bell Labs tradition of selecting names that make marketeers wince.\" The "
"developers also wished to pay homage to the famous film, \"Plan 9 From "
"Outer Space\", considered by some to be the worst movie ever made. The "
"source is available for download under open-source terms. The developers "
"and a small fan base hang out at :samp:`comp.os.plan9`\\, where one can "
"occasionally hear \"If you want UNIX, you know where to find it\""
