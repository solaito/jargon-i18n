"Hackish way of referring to the postal service, analogizing it to a very "
"slow, low-reliability network. Usenet :ref:`sig-block`\\s sometimes "
"include a \"Paper-Net:\" header just before the sender's postal address; "
"common variants of this are \"Papernet\" and \"P-Net\". Note that the "
"standard :ref:`netiquette` guidelines discourage this practice as a waste"
" of bandwidth, since netters are quite unlikely to casually use postal "
"addresses. Compare :ref:`voice-net`\\, :ref:`snail-mail`\\."
