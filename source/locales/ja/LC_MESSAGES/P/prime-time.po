"[from TV programming] Normal high-usage hours on a system or network. "
"Back in the days of big timesharing machines ‘prime time’ was when lots "
"of people were competing for limited cycles, usually the day shift. "
"Avoidance of prime time was traditionally given as a major reason for "
":ref:`night-mode` hacking. The term fell into disuse during the early PC "
"era, but has been revived to refer to times of day or evening at which "
"the Internet tends to be heavily loaded, making Web access slow. The "
"hackish tendency to late-night :ref:`hacking-run`\\s has changed not a "
"bit."
