"The name given to Intel's P5 chip, the successor to the 80486. The name "
"was chosen because of difficulties Intel had in trademarking a number. It"
" suggests the number five (implying 586) while (according to Intel) "
"conveying a meaning of strength \"like titanium\". Among hackers, the "
"plural is frequently ‘pentia’. See also :ref:`Pentagram-Pro`\\."

"Intel did not stick to this convention when naming its P6 processor the "
"Pentium Pro; many believe this is due to difficulties in selling a chip "
"with \"hex\" or \"sex\" in its name. Successor chips have been called "
"Pentium II, Pentium III, and Pentium IV."
