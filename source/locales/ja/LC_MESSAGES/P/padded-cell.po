"Where you put :ref:`luser`\\s so they can't hurt anything. A program that"
" limits a luser to a carefully restricted subset of the capabilities of "
"the host system (for example, the :manpage:`rsh(1)` utility on USG Unix)."
" Note that this is different from an :ref:`iron-box` because it is overt "
"and not aimed at enforcing security so much as protecting others (and the"
" luser) from the consequences of the luser's boundless naivete (see "
":ref:`naive`\\). Also padded cell environment."
