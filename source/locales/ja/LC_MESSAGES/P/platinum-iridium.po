"Standard, against which all others of the same category are measured. "
"Usage: silly. The notion is that one of whatever it is has actually been "
"cast in platinum-iridium alloy and placed in the vault beside the "
"Standard Kilogram at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures "
"near Paris. (From 1889 to 1960, the meter was defined to be the distance "
"between two scratches in a platinum-iridium bar kept in that same vault â€”"
" this replaced an earlier definition as :math:`10^{-7}` times the "
"distance between the North Pole and the Equator along a meridian through "
"Paris; unfortunately, this had been based on an inexact value of the "
"circumference of the Earth. From 1960 to 1984 it was defined to be "
"1650763.73 wavelengths of the orange-red line of krypton-86 propagating "
"in a vacuum. It is now defined as the length of the path traveled by "
"light in a vacuum in the time interval of 1/299,792,458 of a second. The "
"kilogram is now the only unit of measure officially defined in terms of a"
" unique artifact. But this will have to change; in 2003 it was revealed "
"that the reference kilogram has been shedding mass over time, and is down"
" by 50 micrograms.) \"This garbage-collection algorithm has been tested "
"against the platinum-iridium cons cell in Paris.\" Compare "
":ref:`golden`\\."
