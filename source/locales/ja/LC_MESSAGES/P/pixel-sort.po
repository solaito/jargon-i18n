"[Commodore users] Any compression routine which irretrievably loses "
"valuable data in the process of :ref:`crunch`\\ing it. Disparagingly used"
" for ‘lossy’ methods such as JPEG. The theory, of course, is that these "
"methods are only used on photographic images in which minor loss-of-data "
"is not visible to the human eye. The term pixel sort implies distrust of "
"this theory. Compare :ref:`bogo-sort`\\."
