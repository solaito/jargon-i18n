"\"Data expands to fill the space available for storage\"; buying more "
"memory encourages the use of more memory-intensive techniques. (The "
"original 1958 Parkinson's Law described the structural tendency of "
"bureaucracies to make work for themselves.) It has been observed since "
"the mid-1980s that the memory usage of evolving systems tends to double "
"roughly once every 18 months. Fortunately, memory density available for "
"constant dollars also tends to about double once every 18 months (see "
":ref:`Moores-Law`\\); unfortunately, the laws of physics guarantee that "
"the latter cannot continue indefinitely."
