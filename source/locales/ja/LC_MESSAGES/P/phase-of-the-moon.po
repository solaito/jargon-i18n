"Used humorously as a random parameter on which something is said to "
"depend. Sometimes implies unreliability of whatever is dependent, or that"
" reliability seems to be dependent on conditions nobody has been able to "
"determine. \"This feature depends on having the channel open in mumble "
"mode, having the foo switch set, and on the phase of the moon.\" See also"

"True story: Once upon a time there was a program bug that really did "
"depend on the phase of the moon. There was a little subroutine that had "
"traditionally been used in various programs at MIT to calculate an "
"approximation to the moon's true phase. GLS incorporated this routine "
"into a LISP program that, when it wrote out a file, would print a "
"timestamp line almost 80 characters long. Very occasionally the first "
"line of the message would be too long and would overflow onto the next "
"line, and when the file was later read back in the program would "
":ref:`barf`\\. The length of the first line depended on both the precise "
"date and time and the length of the phase specification when the "
"timestamp was printed, and so the bug literally depended on the phase of "
"the moon!"

"The first paper edition of the Jargon File (Steele-1983) included an "
"example of one of the timestamp lines that exhibited this bug, but the "
"typesetter ‘corrected’ it. This has since been described as the phase-of-"
"the-moon-bug bug."

"However, beware of assumptions. A few years ago, engineers of CERN "
"(European Center for Nuclear Research) were baffled by some errors in "
"experiments conducted with the LEP particle accelerator. As the "
"formidable amount of data generated by such devices is heavily processed "
"by computers before being seen by humans, many people suggested the "
"software was somehow sensitive to the phase of the moon. A few desperate "
"engineers discovered the truth; the error turned out to be the result of "
"a tiny change in the geometry of the 27km circumference ring, physically "
"caused by the deformation of the Earth by the passage of the Moon! This "
"story has entered physics folklore as a Newtonian vengeance on particle "
"physics and as an example of the relevance of the simplest and oldest "
"physical laws to the most modern science."
