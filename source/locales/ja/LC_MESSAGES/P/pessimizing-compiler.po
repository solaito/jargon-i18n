"[antonym of techspeak ‘optimizing compiler’] A compiler that produces "
"object code that is worse than the straightforward or obvious hand "
"translation. The implication is that the compiler is actually trying to "
"optimize the program, but through excessive cleverness is doing the "
"opposite. A few pessimizing compilers have been written on purpose, "
"however, as pranks or burlesques."
