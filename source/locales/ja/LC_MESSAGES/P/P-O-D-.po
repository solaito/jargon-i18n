"[rare; sometimes ‘POD’ without the periods] Acronym for ‘Piece Of Data’ "
"or ‘Plain Old Data’ (as opposed to a code section, or a section "
"containing mixed code and data). The latter expansion was in use by the "
"C++ standards committee, for which it indicated a struct or class which "
"only contains data (as in C), distinguished from one which has a "
"constructor and member functions. There are things which you can do with "
"a P.O.D. which you can't with a more general class."
