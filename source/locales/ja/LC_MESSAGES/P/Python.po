"In the words of its author, \"the other scripting language\" (other than "
":ref:`Perl`\\, that is). Python's design is notably clean, elegant, and "
"well thought through; it tends to attract the sort of programmers who "
"find Perl grubby and exiguous. Some people revolt at its use of "
"whitespace to define logical structure by indentation, objecting that "
"this harks back to the horrible old fixed-field languages of the 1960s. "
"Python's relationship with Perl is rather like the :ref:`BSD` community's"
" relationship to :ref:`Linux` — it's the smaller party in a (usually "
"friendly) rivalry, but the average quality of its developers is generally"
" conceded to be rather higher than in the larger community it competes "
"with. There's a Python resource page at `http://www.python.org "
"<http://www.python.org>`_. See also :ref:`Guido`\\, :ref:`BDFL`\\."
