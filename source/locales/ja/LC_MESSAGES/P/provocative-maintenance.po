"[common ironic mutation of preventive maintenance] Actions performed upon"
" a machine at regularly scheduled intervals to ensure that the system "
"remains in a usable state. So called because it is all too often "
"performed by a :ref:`field-servoid` who doesn't know what he is doing; "
"such ‘maintenance’ often *induces* problems, or otherwise results in the "
"machine's remaining in an *un*\\usable state for an indeterminate amount "
"of time. See also :ref:`scratch-monkey`\\."
