"An adhesive-backed label designed to be attached to a key on a keyboard "
"to indicate some non-standard character which can be accessed through "
"that key. Pasties are likely to be used in APL environments, where almost"
" every key is associated with a special character. A pastie on the R key,"
" for example, might remind the user that it is used to generate the ρ "
"character. The term properly refers to nipple-concealing devices formerly"
" worn by strippers in concession to indecent-exposure laws; compare :ref"
":`tits-on-a-keyboard`\\."
