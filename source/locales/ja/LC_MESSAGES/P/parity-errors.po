"Little lapses of attention or (in more severe cases) consciousness, "
"usually brought on by having spent all night and most of the next day "
"hacking. \"I need to go home and crash; I'm starting to get a lot of "
"parity errors.\" Derives from a relatively common but nearly always "
"correctable transient error in memory hardware. It predates RAM; in fact,"
" this term is reported to have already have been in use in its jargon "
"sense back in the 1960s when magnetic cores ruled. Parity errors can also"
" afflict mass storage and serial communication lines; this is more "
"serious because not always correctable."
