"Arrogance; the egotistical conviction that one is above normal human "
"error. Most frequently found among programmers of some native ability but"
" relatively little experience (especially new graduates; their "
"perceptions may be distorted by a history of excellent performance at "
"solving :ref:`toy-problem`\\s). \"Of course my program is correct, there "
"is no need to test it.\" \"Yes, I can see there may be a problem here, "
"but I'll never type :code:`rm -r /` while in :ref:`root-mode`\\.\""
