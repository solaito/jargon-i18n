"An unused block of bits left in a binary so that it can later be modified"
" by insertion of machine-language instructions there (typically, the "
"patch space is modified to contain new code, and the superseded code is "
"patched to contain a jump or call to the patch space). The near-universal"
" use of compilers and interpreters has made this term rare; it is now "
"primarily historical outside IBM shops. See :ref:`patch` (sense 4), "
":ref:`zap` (sense 4), :ref:`hook`\\."
