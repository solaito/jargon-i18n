"[Usenet: possibly influenced by British slang ‘plonk’ for cheap booze, or"
" ‘plonker’ for someone behaving stupidly (latter is lit. equivalent to "
"Yiddish *schmuck*\\)] The sound a :ref:`newbie` makes as he falls to the "
"bottom of a :ref:`kill-file`\\. While it originated in the "
":ref:`newsgroup` :samp:`talk.bizarre`\\, this term (usually written "
"\"\\*plonk\\*\") is now (1994) widespread on Usenet as a form of public "
"ridicule."
