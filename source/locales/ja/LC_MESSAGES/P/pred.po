"[Usenet; orig. fr. the Island MUD via Oxford University] Abbreviation for"
" \"predictable\", used to signify or preempt responses that are extremely"
" predictable but have to be filled in for the sake of form (the phrase is"
" bracketed by <pred>...</pred>). X-Pred headers in mail or news serve the"
" same end. Figuring out the connection between the X-Pred tagline and the"
" thread is part of the entertainment. For example, it is said that any "
"thread about taxation must contain a reference to Raquel Welch, if only "
"to stop other people from mentioning her. This is allegedly due to a "
"Monty Python sketch where a character declares that he would tax Raquel "
"Welch, and he has a feeling she would tax him."
