"At one time phreaking was a semi-respectable activity among hackers; "
"there was a gentleman's agreement that phreaking as an intellectual game "
"and a form of exploration was OK, but serious theft of services was "
"taboo. There was significant crossover between the hacker community and "
"the hard-core phone phreaks who ran semi-underground networks of their "
"own through such media as the legendary *TAP Newsletter*\\. This ethos "
"began to break down in the mid-1980s as wider dissemination of the "
"techniques put them in the hands of less responsible phreaks. Around the "
"same time, changes in the phone network made old-style technical "
"ingenuity less effective as a way of hacking it, so phreaking came to "
"depend more on overtly criminal acts such as stealing phone-card numbers."
" The crimes and punishments of gangs like the ‘414 group’ turned that "
"game very ugly. A few old-time hackers still phreak casually just to keep"
" their hand in, but most these days have hardly even heard of ‘blue "
"boxes’ or any of the other paraphernalia of the great phreaks of yore."
