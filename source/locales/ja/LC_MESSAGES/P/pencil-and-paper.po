"An archaic information storage and transmission device that works by "
"depositing smears of graphite on bleached wood pulp. More recent "
"developments in paper-based technology include improved ‘write-once’ "
"update devices which use tiny rolling heads similar to mouse balls to "
"deposit colored pigment. All these devices require an operator skilled at"
" so-called ‘handwriting’ technique. These technologies are ubiquitous "
"outside hackerdom, but nearly forgotten inside it. Most hackers had "
"terrible handwriting to begin with, and years of keyboarding tend to have"
" encouraged it to degrade further. Perhaps for this reason, hackers "
"deprecate pencil-and-paper technology and often resist using it in any "
"but the most trivial contexts."
