"[scientific computation] Used of a data set that is grossly atypical of "
"normal expected input, esp. one that exposes a weakness or bug in "
"whatever algorithm one is using. An algorithm that can be broken by "
"pathological inputs may still be useful if such inputs are very unlikely "
"to occur in practice."

"When used of test input, implies that it was purposefully engineered as a"
" worst case. The implication in both senses is that the data is "
"spectacularly ill-conditioned or that someone had to explicitly set out "
"to break the algorithm in order to come up with such a crazy example."

"Also said of an unlikely collection of circumstances. \"If the network is"
" down and comes up halfway through the execution of that command by root,"
" the system may just crash.\" \"Yes, but that's a pathological case.\" "
"Often used to dismiss the case from discussion, with the implication that"
" the consequences are acceptable, since they will happen so infrequently "
"(if at all) that it doesn't seem worth going to the extra trouble to "
"handle that case (see sense 1)."
