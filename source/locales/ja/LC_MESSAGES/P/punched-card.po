"[techspeak] (alt. : punch card) The signature medium of computing's :ref"
":`Stone-Age`\\, now obsolescent. The punched card actually predated "
"computers considerably, originating in 1801 as a control device for "
"mechanical looms. The version patented by Hollerith and used with "
"mechanical tabulating machines in the 1890 U.S. Census was a piece of "
"cardboard about 90 mm by 215 mm. There is a widespread myth that it was "
"designed to fit in the currency trays used for that era's larger dollar "
"bills, but recent investigations have falsified this."

"IBM (which originated as a tabulating-machine manufacturer) married the "
"punched card to computers, encoding binary information as patterns of "
"small rectangular holes; one character per column, 80 columns per card. "
"Other coding schemes, sizes of card, and hole shapes were tried at "
"various times."

"The 80-column width of most character terminals is a legacy of the IBM "
"punched card; so is the size of the quick-reference cards distributed "
