"[Unix] Term used for :ref:`shell` code, so called because of the "
"prevalence of pipelines that feed the output of one program to the input "
"of another. Under Unix, user utilities can often be implemented or at "
"least prototyped by a suitable collection of pipelines and temp-file "
"grinding encapsulated in a shell script; this is much less effort than "
"writing C every time, and the capability is considered one of Unix's "
"major winning features. A few other OSs such as IBM's VM/CMS support "
"similar facilities. Esp. : used in the construction hairy plumbing (see "
":ref:`hairy`\\). \"You can kluge together a basic spell-checker out of "
":manpage:`sort(1)`\\, :manpage:`comm(1)`\\, and :manpage:`tr(1)` with a "
"little plumbing.\" See also :ref:`tee`\\."
