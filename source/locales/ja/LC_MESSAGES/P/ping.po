"n\\. Slang term for a small network message (ICMP ECHO) sent by a "
"computer to check for the presence and alertness of another. The Unix "
"command :manpage:`ping(8)` can be used to do this manually (note that "
":manpage:`ping(8)`\\'s author denies the widespread folk etymology that "
"the name was ever intended as an acronym for ‘Packet INternet Groper’). "
"Occasionally used as a phone greeting. See :ref:`ACK`\\, also "
":ref:`ENQ`\\."

"n\\. A quantum packet of happiness. People who are very happy tend to "
"exude pings; furthermore, one can intentionally create pings and aim them"
" at a needy party (e.g., a depressed person). This sense of ping may "
"appear as an exclamation; \"Ping!\" (I'm happy; I am emitting a quantum "
"of happiness; I have been struck by a quantum of happiness). The form "
"\"pingfulness\", which is used to describe people who exude pings, also "
"occurs. (In the standard abuse of language, \"pingfulness\" can also be "
"used as an exclamation, in which case it's a much stronger exclamation "
"than just \"ping\"!). Oppose :ref:`blargh`\\."

"The funniest use of ‘ping’ to date was `described "
"<http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=1991Jan23.211609.877%40news.cs.indiana.edu>`_\\"
"  in January 1991 by Steve Hayman on the Usenet group "
":samp:`comp.sys.next`\\. He was trying to isolate a faulty cable segment "
"on a TCP/IP Ethernet hooked up to a NeXT machine, and got tired of having"
" to run back to his console after each cabling tweak to see if the ping "
"packets were getting through. So he used the sound-recording feature on "
"the NeXT, then wrote a script that repeatedly invoked "
":manpage:`ping(8)`\\, listened for an echo, and played back the recording"
" on each returned packet. Result? A program that caused the machine to "
"repeat, over and over, \"Ping ... ping ... ping ...\" as long as the "
"network was up. He turned the volume to maximum, ferreted through the "
"building with one ear cocked, and found a faulty tee connector in no "
"time."
