"[Practical Extraction and Report Language, a.k.a. Pathologically Eclectic"
" Rubbish Lister] An interpreted language developed by Larry Wall, author "
"of :manpage:`patch(1)` and :manpage:`rn(1)`\\). Superficially resembles "
":ref:`awk`\\, but is much hairier, including many facilities reminiscent "
"of :manpage:`sed(1)` and shells and a comprehensive Unix system-call "
"interface. Unix sysadmins, who are almost always incorrigible hackers, "
"generally consider it one of the :ref:`languages-of-choice`\\, and it is "
"by far the most widely used tool for making ‘live’ web pages via CGI. "
"Perl has been described, in a parody of a famous remark about "
":manpage:`lex(1)`\\, as the :ref:`Swiss-Army-chainsaw` of Unix "
"programming. Though Perl is very useful, it would be a stretch to "
"describe it as pretty or :ref:`elegant`\\; people who like clean, spare "
"design generally prefer :ref:`Python`\\. See also :ref:`Camel-Book`\\, "
":ref:`TMTOWTDI`\\."
