"An Algol-descended language designed by Niklaus Wirth on the CDC 6600 "
"around 1967--68 as an instructional tool for elementary programming. This"
" language, designed primarily to keep students from shooting themselves "
"in the foot and thus extremely restrictive from a general-purpose-"
"programming point of view, was later promoted as a general-purpose tool "
"and, in fact, became the ancestor of a large family of languages "
"including Modula-2 and Ada (see also :ref:`bondage-and-discipline-"
"language`\\). The hackish point of view on Pascal was probably best "
"summed up by a devastating (and, in its deadpan way, screamingly funny) "
"1981 paper by Brian Kernighan (of :ref:`K-ampersand-R` fame) entitled "
"*Why Pascal is Not My Favorite Programming Language*\\, which was turned "
"down by the technical journals but circulated widely via photocopies. It "
"was eventually published in *Comparing and Assessing Programming "
"Languages*\\, edited by Alan Feuer and Narain Gehani (Prentice-Hall, "
"1984). Part of his discussion is worth repeating here, because its "
"criticisms are still apposite to Pascal itself after many years of "
"improvement and could also stand as an indictment of many other bondage-"
"and-discipline languages. (The entire essay is available at "
"`http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/bwk-on-pascal.html "
"<http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/bwk-on-pascal.html>`_.) At the end of a "
"summary of the case against Pascal, Kernighan wrote:"

"Pascal has since been entirely displaced (mainly by :ref:`C`\\) from the "
"niches it had acquired in serious applications and systems programming, "
"and from its role as a teaching language by Java."
