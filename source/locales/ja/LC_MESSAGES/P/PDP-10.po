"[Programmed Data Processor model 10] The machine that made "
":ref:`timesharing` real. It looms large in hacker folklore because of its"
" adoption in the mid-1970s by many university computing facilities and "
"research labs, including the MIT AI Lab, Stanford, and CMU. Some aspects "
"of the instruction set (most notably the bit-field instructions) are "
"still considered unsurpassed. The 10 was eventually eclipsed by the "
":ref:`VAX` machines (descendants of the :ref:`PDP-11`\\) when :ref:`DEC` "
"recognized that the 10 and :ref:`VAX` product lines were competing with "
"each other and decided to concentrate its software development effort on "
"the more profitable :ref:`VAX`\\. The machine was finally dropped from "
"DEC's line in 1983, following the failure of the Jupiter Project at DEC "
"to build a viable new model. (Some attempts by other companies to market "
"clones came to nothing; see :ref:`Foonly` and :ref:`Mars`\\.) This event "
"spelled the doom of :ref:`ITS` and the technical cultures that had "
"spawned the original Jargon File, but by mid-1991 it had become something"
" of a badge of honorable old-timerhood among hackers to have cut one's "
"teeth on a PDP-10. See :ref:`TOPS-10`\\, :ref:`ITS`\\, :ref:`BLT`\\, "
":ref:`DDT`\\, :ref:`EXCH`\\, :ref:`HAKMEM`\\, :ref:`pop`\\, "
":ref:`push`\\. See also `http://www.inwap.com/pdp10/ "
