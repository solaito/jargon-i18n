msgid ""
"An electronic-mail or :ref:`Usenet` persona adopted by a human for "
"amusement value or as a means of avoiding negative repercussions of one's"
" net.behavior; a ‘nom de Usenet’, often associated with forged postings "
"designed to conceal message origins. Perhaps the best-known and funniest "
"hoax of this type is :ref:`B1FF`\\. See also :ref:`tentacle`\\."

"Notionally, a :ref:`flamage`\\-generating AI program simulating a Usenet "
"user. Many flamers have been accused of actually being such entities, "
"despite the fact that no AI program of the required sophistication yet "
"exists. However, in 1989 there was a famous series of forged postings "
"that used a phrase-frequency-based travesty generator to simulate the "
"styles of several well-known flamers; it was based on large samples of "
"their back postings (compare :ref:`Dissociated-Press`\\). A significant "
"number of people were fooled by the forgeries, and the debate over their "
"authenticity was settled only when the perpetrator came forward to "
"publicly admit the hoax."
