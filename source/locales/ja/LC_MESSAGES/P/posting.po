"Noun corresp. to v.: :ref:`post` (but note that :ref:`post` can be "
"nouned). Distinguished from a ‘letter’ or ordinary :ref:`email` message "
"by the fact that it is broadcast rather than point-to-point. It is not "
"clear whether messages sent to a small mailing list are postings or "
"email; perhaps the best dividing line is that if you don't know the names"
" of all the potential recipients, it is a posting."
