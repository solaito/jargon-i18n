"The most famous computer that never was. :ref:`PDP-10` computers running "
"the :ref:`TOPS-10` operating system were labeled ‘DECsystem-10’ as a way "
"of differentiating them from the :ref:`PDP-11`\\. Later on, those systems"
" running :ref:`TOPS-20` were labeled ‘DECSYSTEM-20’ (the block capitals "
"being the result of a lawsuit brought against DEC by Singer, which once "
"made a computer called ‘system-10’), but contrary to popular lore there "
"was never a ‘PDP-20’; the only difference between a 10 and a 20 was the "
"operating system and the color of the paint. Most (but not all) machines "
"sold to run TOPS-10 were painted ‘Basil Blue’, whereas most TOPS-20 "
"machines were painted ‘Chinese Red’ (often mistakenly called orange)."
