"A backgammon prime (six consecutive occupied points) with one point "
"missing. This term is an esoteric pun derived from number theory: a "
"number that passes a certain kind of \"primality test\" may be called a "
"pseudoprime (all primes pass any such test, but so do some composite "
"numbers), and any number that passes several is, in some sense, almost "
"certainly prime. The hacker backgammon usage stems from the idea that a "
"pseudoprime is almost as good as a prime: it will do the same job unless "
"you are unlucky."
