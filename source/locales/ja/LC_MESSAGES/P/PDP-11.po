"Possibly the single most successful minicomputer design in history, a "
"favorite of hackers for many years, and the first major Unix machine, The"
" first PDP-11s (the 11/15 and 11/20) shipped in 1970 from :ref:`DEC`\\; "
"the last (11/93 and 11/94) in 1990. Along the way, the 11 gave birth to "
"the :ref:`VAX`\\, strongly influenced the design of microprocessors such "
"as the Motorola 6800 and Intel 386, and left a permanent imprint on the C"
" language (which has an odd preference for octal embedded in its syntax "
"because of the way PDP-11 machine instructions were formatted). There is "
"a `history site <http://telnet.hu/hamster/pdp-11/>`_."
