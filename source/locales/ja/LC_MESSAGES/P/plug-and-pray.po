"Parody of the techspeak term plug-and-play, describing a PC peripheral "
"card which is claimed to have no need for hardware configuration via "
"jumpers or DIP switches, and which should work as soon as it is inserted "
"in the PC. Unfortunately, even the PCI bus is all too often not up to "
"pulling this off reliably, and people who have to do installation or "
"troubleshoot PCs soon find themselves longing for the jumpers and "
"switches."
