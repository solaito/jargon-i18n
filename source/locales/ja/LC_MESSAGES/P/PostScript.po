"A page description language, based on work originally done by John "
"Gaffney at Evans and Sutherland in 1976, evolving through ‘JaM’ (‘John "
"and Martin’, Martin Newell) at :ref:`XEROX-PARC`\\, and finally "
"implemented in its current form by John Warnock et al. after he and Chuck"
" Geschke founded Adobe Systems Incorporated in 1982. PostScript gets its "
"leverage by using a full programming language, rather than a series of "
"low-level escape sequences, to describe an image to be printed on a laser"
" printer or other output device (in this it parallels :ref:`EMACS`\\, "
"which exploited a similar insight about editing tasks). It is also "
"noteworthy for implementing on-the fly rasterization, from Bezier curve "
"descriptions, of high-quality fonts at low (e.g. 300 dpi) resolution (it "
"was formerly believed that hand-tuned bitmap fonts were required for this"
" task). Hackers consider PostScript to be among the most elegant hacks of"
" all time, and the combination of technical merits and widespread "
"availability has made PostScript the language of choice for graphical "
"output."
