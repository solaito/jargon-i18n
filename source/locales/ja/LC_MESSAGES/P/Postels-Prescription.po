"[proposed] Several of the key Internet :ref:`RFC`\\s, especially 1122 and"
" 791 contain a piece of advice due to Jon Postel, which is most often "
"stated as:"

"That is, a well-engineered implementation of any of the Internet "
"protocols should be willing to deal with marginal and imperfectly-formed "
"inputs, but should not assume that the program on the other end (that is,"
" the program dealing with the well-engineered implementation's output) "
"will be anything other than rigid and inflexible, and perhaps even "
"incomplete or downright buggy."

"This property is valuable because a network of programs adhering to it "
"will be much more robust in the presence of any uncertainties in the "
"protocol specifications, or any individual implementor's failure to "
"understand those specifications perfectly. Though the policy does tend to"
" accommodate broken implementations it is held to more important to get "
"the communication flowing than to immediately (but terminally) diagnose "
"the broken implementations at the expense of the people trying to use "
"them."

"The principle is a well-known one in the design of programs that handle "
"Internet wire protocols, especially network relays and servers, and it is"
" regularly applied by extension in any situation where two or more "
"separately-implemented pieces of software are supposed to interoperate "
"even though the various implementors have never talked to each other and "
"have absolutely nothing whatsoever in common other than having all read "
"the same protocol specification. The principle travels under several "
"different names, including \"the Internet credo\", \"the IETF maxim\", "
"\"the Internet Engineering Principle\", and \"the liberal/conservative "
"rule\"; the [proposed] term \"Postel' Prescription\" is a tribute to its "
"inventor, the first RFC editor and (until his untimely death) probably "
"the single most respected individual in the Internet engineering "
"community."
