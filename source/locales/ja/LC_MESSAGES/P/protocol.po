"As used by hackers, this never refers to niceties about the proper form "
"for addressing letters to the Papal Nuncio or the order in which one "
"should use the forks in a Russian-style place setting; hackers don't care"
" about such things. It is used instead to describe any set of rules that "
"allow different machines or pieces of software to coordinate with each "
"other without ambiguity. So, for example, it does include niceties about "
"the proper form for addressing packets on a network or the order in which"
" one should use the forks in the Dining Philosophers Problem. It implies "
"that there is some common message format and an accepted set of "
"primitives or commands that all parties involved understand, and that "
"transactions among them follow predictable logical sequences. See also "
":ref:`handshaking`\\, :ref:`do-protocol`\\."
