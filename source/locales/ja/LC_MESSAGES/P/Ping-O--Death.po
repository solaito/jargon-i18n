"A notorious :ref:`exploit` that (when first discovered) could be easily "
"used to crash a wide variety of machines by overrunning size limits in "
"their TCP/IP stacks. First revealed in late 1996. The open-source Unix "
"community patched its systems to remove the vulnerability within days or "
"weeks, the closed-source OS vendors generally took months. While the "
"difference in response times repeated a pattern familiar from other "
"security incidents, the accompanying glare of Web-fueled publicity proved"
" unusually embarrassing to the OS vendors and so passed into history and "
"myth. The term is now used to refer to any nudge delivered by network "
"wizards over the network that causes bad things to happen on the system "
"being nudged. For the full story on the original exploit, see "
"`http://www.insecure.org/sploits/ping-o-death.html "
"<http://www.insecure.org/sploits/ping-o-death.html>`_. Compare :ref"
":`kamikaze-packet` and 'Chernobyl packet.'"
