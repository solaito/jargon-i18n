"n\\. The offset of one's waking-sleeping schedule with respect to the "
"standard 24-hour cycle; a useful concept among people who often work at "
"night and/or according to no fixed schedule. It is not uncommon to change"
" one's phase by as much as 6 hours per day on a regular basis. \"What's "
"your phase?\" \"I've been getting in about 8PM lately, but I'm going to "
":ref:`wrap-around` to the day schedule by Friday.\" A person who is "
"roughly 12 hours out of phase is sometimes said to be in night mode. (The"
" term day mode is also (but less frequently) used, meaning you're working"
" 9 to 5 (or, more likely, 10 to 6).) The act of altering one's cycle is "
"called changing phase; phase shifting has also been recently reported "
"from Caltech."

"change phase the easy way: To stay asleep, etc. However, some claim that "
"either staying awake longer or sleeping longer is easy, and that it is "
"*shortening* your day or night that is really hard (see :ref:`wrap-"
"around`\\). The ‘jet lag’ that afflicts travelers who cross many time-"
"zone boundaries may be attributed to two distinct causes: the strain of "
"travel per se, and the strain of changing phase. Hackers who suddenly "
"find that they must change phase drastically in a short period of time, "
"particularly the hard way, experience something very like jet lag without"
" traveling."
