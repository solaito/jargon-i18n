"A large and indeterminate number of objects: \"There were ``N`` bugs in "
"that crock!\" Also used in its original sense of a variable name: \"This "
"crock has ``N`` bugs, as ``N`` goes to infinity.\" (The true number of "
"bugs is always at least ``N + 1``\\; see :ref:`Lubarskys-Law-of-"
"Cybernetic-Entomology`\\.)"

"A variable whose value is inherited from the current context. For "
"example, when a meal is being ordered at a restaurant, ``N`` may be "
"understood to mean however many people there are at the table. From the "
"remark \"We'd like to order ``N`` wonton soups and a family dinner for "
"``N - 1``\\\" you can deduce that one person at the table wants to eat "
"only soup, even though you don't know how many people there are (see :ref"
":`great-wall`\\)."

"\"Now for the ``N``\\th and last time...\" In the specific context \"``N"

"and is usually 5 or more (see :ref:`tenured-graduate-student`\\). See "
