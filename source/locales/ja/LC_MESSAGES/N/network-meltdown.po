"Network meltdown is often a result of network designs that are optimized "
"for a steady state of moderate load and don't cope well with the very "
"jagged, bursty usage patterns of the real world. One amusing instance of "
"this is triggered by the popular and very bloody shoot-'em-up game *Doom*"
" on the PC. When used in multiplayer mode over a network, the game uses "
"broadcast packets to inform other machines when bullets are fired. This "
"causes problems with weapons like the chain gun which fire rapidly â€” it "
"can blast the network into a meltdown state just as easily as it shreds "
"opposing monsters."
