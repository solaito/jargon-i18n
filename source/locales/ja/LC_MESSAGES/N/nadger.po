"[UK, from rude slang noun nadgers for testicles; compare American & "
"British bollixed] Of software or hardware (not people), to twiddle some "
"object in a hidden manner, generally so that it conforms better to some "
"format. For instance, string printing routines on 8-bit processors often "
"take the string text from the instruction stream, thus a print call looks"
" like :code:`jsr print:\"Hello world\"`\\. The print routine has to "
"nadger the saved instruction pointer so that the processor doesn't try to"
" execute the text as instructions when the subroutine returns. See "
":ref:`adger`\\."
