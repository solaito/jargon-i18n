"The label used to refer to one of the continuing :ref:`holy-wars` in AI "
"research. This conflict tangles together two separate issues. One is the "
"relationship between human reasoning and AI; ‘neats’ tend to try to build"
" systems that ‘reason’ in some way identifiably similar to the way humans"
" report themselves as doing, while ‘scruffies’ profess not to care "
"whether an algorithm resembles human reasoning in the least as long as it"
" works. More importantly, neats tend to believe that logic is king, while"
" scruffies favor looser, more ad-hoc methods driven by empirical "
"knowledge. To a neat, scruffy methods appear promiscuous, successful only"
" by accident, and not productive of insights about how intelligence "
"actually works; to a scruffy, neat methods appear to be hung up on "
"formalism and irrelevant to the hard-to-capture ‘common sense’ of living "
"intelligences."
