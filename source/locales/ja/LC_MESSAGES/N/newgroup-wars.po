"[Usenet] The salvos of dueling :code:`newgroup` and :code:`rmgroup` "
"messages sometimes exchanged by persons on opposite sides of a dispute "
"over whether a :ref:`newsgroup` should be created net-wide, or (even more"
" frequently) whether an obsolete one should be removed. These usually "
"settle out within a week or two as it becomes clear whether the group has"
" a natural constituency (usually, it doesn't). At times, especially in "
"the completely anarchic :samp:`alt` hierarchy, the names of newsgroups "
"themselves become a form of comment or humor; e.g., the group "
":samp:`alt.swedish.chef.bork.bork.bork` which originated as a birthday "
"joke for a Muppets fan, or any number of specialized abuse groups named "
"after particularly notorious :ref:`flamer`\\s, e.g., "
":samp:`alt.weemba`\\."
