"Var. clit mouse, clitoris Common term for the pointing device used on IBM"
" ThinkPads and a few other laptop computers. The device, which sits "
"between the ‘g’ and ‘h’ keys on the keyboard, indeed resembles a rubber "
"nipple intended to be tweaked by a forefinger. Many hackers consider "
"these superior to the glide pads found on most laptops, which are harder "
"to control precisely."
