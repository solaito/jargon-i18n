"The trait of being excited and pleased by novelty. Common among most "
"hackers, SF fans, and members of several other connected leading-edge "
"subcultures, including the pro-technology ‘Whole Earth’ wing of the "
"ecology movement, space activists, many members of Mensa, and the "
"Discordian/neo-pagan underground (see :ref:`geek`\\). All these groups "
"overlap heavily and (where evidence is available) seem to share "
"characteristic hacker tropisms for science fiction, :ref:`music`\\, and "
":ref:`oriental-food`\\. The opposite tendency is neophobia."
