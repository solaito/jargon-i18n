"[from v. nibble by analogy with ‘bite’ → ‘byte’] Four bits; one "
":ref:`hex` digit; a half-byte. Though ‘byte’ is now techspeak, this "
"useful relative is still jargon. Compare :ref:`byte`\\; see also "
":ref:`bit`\\. The more mundane spelling \"nibble\" is also commonly used."
" Apparently the ‘nybble’ spelling is uncommon in Commonwealth Hackish, as"
" British orthography would suggest the pronunciation /ni:´bl/."

"Following ‘bit’, ‘byte’ and ‘nybble’ there have been quite a few "
"analogical attempts to construct unambiguous terms for bit blocks of "
"other sizes. All of these are strictly jargon, not techspeak, and not "
"very common jargon at that (most hackers would recognize them in context "
"but not use them spontaneously). We collect them here for reference "
"together with the ambiguous techspeak terms ‘word’, ‘half-word’, ‘double "
"word’, and ‘quad’ or quad word; some (indicated) have substantial "
"information separate entries."
