"Small and un-useful, but demonstrating a point. Noddy programs are often "
"written by people learning a new language or system. The archetypal noddy"
" program is :ref:`hello-world`\\. Noddy code may be used to demonstrate a"
" feature or bug of a compiler. May be used of real hardware or software "
"to imply that it isn't worth using. \"This editor's a bit noddy.\""

"A program that is more or less instant to produce. In this use, the term "
"does not necessarily connote uselessness, but describes a :ref:`hack` "
"sufficiently trivial that it can be written and debugged while carrying "
"on (and during the space of) a normal conversation. \"I'll just throw "
"together a noddy :ref:`awk` script to dump all the first fields.\" In "
"North America this might be called a :ref:`mickey-mouse-program`\\. See "
":ref:`toy-program`\\."
