"[IRC, MUD] A condition that occurs when the delays in the :ref:`IRC` "
"network or on a :ref:`MUD` become severe enough that servers briefly lose"
" and then reestablish contact, causing messages to be delivered in "
"bursts, often with delays of up to a minute. (Note that this term has "
"nothing to do with mainstream \"jet lag\", a condition which hackers tend"
" not to be much bothered by.) Often shortened to just ‘lag’."
