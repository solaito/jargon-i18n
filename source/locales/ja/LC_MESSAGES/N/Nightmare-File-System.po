"Pejorative hackerism for Sun's Network File System (NFS). In any "
"nontrivial network of Suns where there is a lot of NFS cross-mounting, "
"when one Sun goes down, the others often freeze up. Some machine tries to"
" access the down one, and (getting no response) repeats indefinitely. "
"This causes it to appear dead to some messages (what is actually "
"happening is that it is locked up in what should have been a brief "
"excursion to a higher :ref:`spl` level). Then another machine tries to "
"reach either the down machine or the pseudo-down machine, and itself "
"becomes pseudo-down. The first machine to discover the down one is now "
"trying both to access the down one and to respond to the pseudo-down one,"
" so it is even harder to reach. This situation snowballs very quickly, "
"and soon the entire network of machines is frozen â€” worst of all, the "
"user can't even abort the file access that started the problem! Many of "
"NFS's problems are excused by partisans as being an inevitable result of "
"its statelessness, which is held to be a great feature (critics, of "
"course, call it a great :ref:`misfeature`\\). (ITS partisans are apt to "
"cite this as proof of Unix's alleged bogosity; ITS had a working NFS-like"
" shared file system with none of these problems in the early 1970s.) See "
"also :ref:`broadcast-storm`\\."
