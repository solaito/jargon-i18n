"Untutored in the perversities of some particular program or system; one "
"who still tries to do things in an intuitive way, rather than the right "
"way (in really good designs these coincide, but most designs aren't "
"‘really good’ in the appropriate sense). This trait is completely "
"unrelated to general maturity or competence, or even competence at any "
"other specific program. It is a sad commentary on the primitive state of "
"computing that the natural opposite of this term is often claimed to be "
"experienced user but is really more like cynical user."

"Said of an algorithm that doesn't take advantage of some superior but "
"advanced technique, e.g., the :ref:`bubble-sort`\\. It may imply naivete "
"on the part of the programmer, although there are situations where a "
"naive algorithm is preferred, because it is more important to keep the "
"code comprehensible than to go for maximum performance. \"I know the "
"linear search is naive, but in this case the list typically only has half"
" a dozen items.\" Compare :ref:`brute-force`\\."
