"(also net address) As used by hackers, means an address on ‘the’ network "
"(see :ref:`the-network`\\; this used to include :ref:`bang-path` "
"addresses but now always implies an Internet address). Net addresses are "
"often used in email text as a more concise substitute for personal names;"
" indeed, hackers may come to know each other quite well by network names "
"without ever learning each others' ‘legal’ monikers. Display of a network"
" address (e.g. on business cards) used to function as an important hacker"
" identification signal, like lodge pins among Masons or tie-dyed T-shirts"
" among Grateful Dead fans. In the day of pervasive Internet this is less "
"true, but you can still be fairly sure that anyone with a network address"
" handwritten on his or her convention badge is a hacker."
