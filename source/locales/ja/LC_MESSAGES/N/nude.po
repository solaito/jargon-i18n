"Said of machines delivered without an operating system (compare :ref"
":`bare-metal`\\). \"We ordered 50 systems, but they all arrived nude, so "
"we had to spend an extra weekend with the installation disks.\" This "
"usage is a recent innovation reflecting the fact that most IBM-PC clones "
"are now delivered with an operating system pre-installed at the factory. "
"Other kinds of hardware are still normally delivered without OS, so this "
"term is particular to PC support groups."
