"[very common; orig. from British public-school and military slang variant"
" of ‘new boy’] A Usenet neophyte. This term surfaced in the "
":ref:`newsgroup` :samp:`talk.bizarre` but is now in wide use (the "
"combination \"clueless newbie\" is especially common). Criteria for being"
" considered a newbie vary wildly; a person can be called a newbie in one "
"newsgroup while remaining a respected regular in another. The label "
"newbie is sometimes applied as a serious insult to a person who has been "
"around Usenet for a long time but who carefully hides all evidence of "
"having a clue. See :ref:`B1FF`\\; see also :ref:`gnubie`\\. Compare "
":ref:`chainik`\\, :ref:`luser`\\."
