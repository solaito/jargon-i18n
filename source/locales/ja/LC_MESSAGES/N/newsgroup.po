":ref:`fora`\\. Usenet groups can be unmoderated (anyone can post) or "
"moderated (submissions are automatically directed to a moderator, who "
"edits or filters and then posts the results). Some newsgroups have "
"parallel :ref:`mailing-list`\\s for Internet people with no netnews "
"access, with postings to the group automatically propagated to the list "
"and vice versa. Some moderated groups (especially those which are "
"actually gatewayed Internet mailing lists) are distributed as digests, "
"with groups of postings periodically collected into a single large "
"posting with an index."
