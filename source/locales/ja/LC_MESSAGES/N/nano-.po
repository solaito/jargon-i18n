"[SI: the next quantifier below :ref:`micro-`\\; meaning :math:`Ã— "
"10^{-9}`\\] Smaller than :ref:`micro-`\\, and used in the same rather "
"loose and connotative way. Thus, one has :ref:`nanotechnology` (coined by"
" hacker K. Eric Drexler) by analogy with microtechnology; and a few "
"machine architectures have a nanocode level below microcode. Tom Duff at "
"Bell Labs has also pointed out that \"Pi seconds is a nanocentury\". See "
"also :ref:`quantifiers`\\, :ref:`pico-`\\, :ref:`nanoacre`\\, "
":ref:`nanobot`\\, :ref:`nanocomputer`\\, :ref:`nanofortnight`\\."
