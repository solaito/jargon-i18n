"The National Security Agency trawling program sometimes assumed to be "
"reading the net for the U.S. Government's spooks. Most hackers used to "
"think it was mythical but believed in acting as though existed just in "
"case. Since the mid-1990s it has gradually become known that the NSA "
"actually does this, quite illegally, through its Echelon program."

"The standard countermeasure is to put loaded phrases like ‘KGB’, ‘Uzi’, "
"‘nuclear materials’, ‘Palestine’, ‘cocaine’, and ‘assassination’ in their"
" :ref:`sig-block`\\s in a (probably futile) attempt to confuse and "
"overload the creature. The :ref:`GNU` version of :ref:`EMACS` actually "
"has a command that randomly inserts a bunch of insidious anarcho-verbiage"
" into your edited text."

"As far back as the 1970s there was a mainstream variant of this myth "
"involving a ‘Trunk Line Monitor’, which supposedly used speech "
"recognition to extract words from telephone trunks. This is much harder "
"than noticing keywords in email, and most of the people who originally "
"propagated it had no idea of then-current technology or the storage, "
"signal-processing, or speech recognition needs of such a project. On the "
"basis of mass-storage costs alone it would have been cheaper to hire 50 "
"high-school students and just let them listen in."

"Twenty years and several orders of technological magnitude later, "
"however, there are clear indications that the NSA has actually deployed "
"such filtering (again, very much against U.S. law). In 2000, the FBI "
"wants to get into this act with its ‘Carnivore’ surveillance system."
