"A hypothetical fabrication technology in which objects are designed and "
"built with the individual specification and placement of each separate "
"atom. The first unequivocal nanofabrication experiments took place in "
"1990, for example with the deposition of individual xenon atoms on a "
"nickel substrate to spell the logo of a certain very large computer "
"company. Nanotechnology has been a hot topic in the hacker subculture "
"ever since the term was coined by K. Eric Drexler in his book *Engines of"
" Creation* (Anchor/Doubleday, ISBN 0-385-19973-2), where he predicted "
"that nanotechnology could give rise to replicating assemblers, permitting"
" an exponential growth of productivity and personal wealth (there's an "
"authorized transcription at `http://www.foresight.org/EOC/index.html "
"<http://www.foresight.org/EOC/index.html>`_). See also :ref:`blue-goo`\\,"
