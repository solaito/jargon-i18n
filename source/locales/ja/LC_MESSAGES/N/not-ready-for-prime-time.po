"Usable, but only just so; not very robust; for internal use only. Said of"
" a program or device. Often connotes that the thing will be made more "
"solid :ref:`Real-Soon-Now`\\. This term comes from the ensemble name of "
"the original cast of *Saturday Night Live*\\, the \"Not Ready for Prime "
"Time Players\". It has extra flavor for hackers because of the special "
"(though now semi-obsolescent) meaning of :ref:`prime-time`\\. Compare "
":ref:`beta`\\."
