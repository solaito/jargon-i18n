"\"The first 90% of the code accounts for the first 90% of the development"
" time. The remaining 10% of the code accounts for the other 90% of the "
"development time.\" Attributed to Tom Cargill of Bell Labs, and "
"popularized by Jon Bentley's September 1985 *Bumper-Sticker Computer "
"Science* column in *Communications of the ACM*\\. It was there called the"
" \"Rule of Credibility\", a name which seems not to have stuck. Other "
"maxims in the same vein include the law attributed to the early British "
"computer scientist Douglas Hartree: \"The time from now until the "
"completion of the project tends to become constant.\""
