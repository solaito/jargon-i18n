"[Usenet] The newsgroups news.admin.net-abuse.\\*, devoted to fighting "
":ref:`spam` and network abuse. Each individual newsgroup is often "
"referred to by adding a letter to NANA. For example, NANAU would refer to"
" :samp:`news.admin.net-abuse.usenet`\\."

"When spam began to be a serious problem around 1995, and a loose network "
"of anti-spammers formed to combat it, spammers immediately accused them "
"of being the :ref:`backbone-cabal`\\, or the Cabal reborn. Though this "
"was not true, spam-fighters ironically accepted the label and the tag "
"line \"There is No Cabal\" reappeared (later, and now commonly, "
"abbreviated to \"TINC\"). Nowadays \"the Cabal\" is generally understood "
"to refer to the NANA regulars."
