"Recognized shorthand on the Usenet group :samp:`comp.std.c` for any "
"unexpected behavior of a C compiler on encountering an undefined "
"construct. During a discussion on that group in early 1992, a regular "
"remarked \"When the compiler encounters [a given undefined construct] it "
"is legal for it to make demons fly out of your nose\" (the implication is"
" that the compiler may choose any arbitrarily bizarre way to interpret "
"the code without violating the ANSI C standard). Someone else followed up"
" with a reference to \"nasal demons\", which quickly became established. "
