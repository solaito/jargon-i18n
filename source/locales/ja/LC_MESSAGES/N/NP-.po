"Extremely. Used to modify adjectives describing a level or quality of "
"difficulty; the connotation is often ‘more so than it should be’. This is"
" generalized from the computer-science terms NP-hard and NP-complete; NP-"
"complete problems all seem to be very hard, but so far no one has found a"
" proof that they are. NP is the set of Nondeterministic-Polynomial "
"problems, those that can be completed by a nondeterministic Turing "
"machine in an amount of time that is a polynomial function of the size of"
" the input; a solution for one NP-complete problem would solve all the "
"others. \"Coding a BitBlt implementation to perform correctly in every "
"case is NP-annoying.\""

"Note, however, that strictly speaking this usage is misleading; there are"
" plenty of easy problems in class NP. NP-complete problems are hard not "
"because they are in class NP, but because they are the hardest problems "
"in class NP."
