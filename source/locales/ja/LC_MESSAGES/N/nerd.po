"The word itself appears to derive from the lines \"And then, just to show"
" them, I'll sail to Ka-Troo / And Bring Back an It-Kutch, a Preep and a "
"Proo, / A Nerkle, a Nerd, and a Seersucker, too!\" in the Dr. Seuss book "
"*If I Ran the Zoo* (1950). (The spellings ‘nurd’ and ‘gnurd’ also used to"
" be current at MIT, where ‘nurd’ is reported from as far back as 1957; "
"however, :ref:`knurd` appears to have a separate etymology.) How it "
"developed its mainstream meaning is unclear, but sense 1 seems to have "
"entered mass culture in the early 1970s (there are reports that in the "
"mid-1960s it meant roughly \"annoying misfit\" without the connotation of"
" intelligence."

"Hackers developed sense 2 in self-defense perhaps ten years later, and "
"some actually wear \"Nerd Pride\" buttons, only half as a joke. At MIT "
"one can find not only buttons but (what else?) pocket protectors bearing "
"the slogan and the MIT seal."
