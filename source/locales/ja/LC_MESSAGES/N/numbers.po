"[scientific computation] Output of a computation that may not be "
"significant results but at least indicate that the program is running. "
"May be used to placate management, grant sponsors, etc. Making numbers "
"means running a program because output — any output, not necessarily "
"meaningful output — is needed as a demonstration of progress. See :ref"
":`pretty-pictures`\\, :ref:`math-out`\\, :ref:`social-science-number`\\."
