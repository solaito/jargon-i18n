"[Unix] A dungeon game similar to :ref:`rogue` but more elaborate, "
"distributed in C source over :ref:`Usenet` and very popular at Unix sites"
" and on PC-class machines (nethack is probably the most widely "
"distributed of the freeware dungeon games). The earliest versions, "
"written by Jay Fenlason and later considerably enhanced by Andries "
"Brouwer, were simply called ‘hack’. The name changed when maintenance was"
" taken over by a group of hackers originally organized by Mike "
"Stephenson. There is now an official site at `http://www.nethack.org/ "
"<http://www.nethack.org/>`_. See also :ref:`moria`\\, :ref:`rogue`\\, "
":ref:`Angband`\\."
