"Terminally :ref:`baroque`\\. Used to imply that a program has become so "
"encrusted with the software equivalent of gold leaf and curlicues that "
"they have completely swamped the underlying design. Called after the "
"later and more extreme forms of Baroque architecture and decoration "
"prevalent during the mid-1700s in Europe. Alan Perlis said: \"Every "
"program eventually becomes rococo, and then rubble.\" Compare :ref"
":`critical-mass`\\."
