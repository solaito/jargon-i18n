"[Usenet: from ‘rotate alphabet 13 places’] The simple Caesar-cypher "
"encryption that replaces each English letter with the one 13 places "
"forward or back along the alphabet, so that \"The butler did it!\" "
"becomes \"Gur ohgyre qvq vg!\" Most Usenet news reading and posting "
"programs include a rot13 feature. It is used to enclose the text in a "
"sealed wrapper that the reader must choose to open — e.g., for posting "
"things that might offend some readers, or :ref:`spoiler`\\s. A major "
"advantage of rot13 over rot(``N``\\) for other ``N`` is that it is self-"
"inverse, so the same code can be used for encoding and decoding. See also"
" :ref:`spoiler-space`\\, which has partly displaced rot13 since non-Unix-"
"based newsreaders became common."
