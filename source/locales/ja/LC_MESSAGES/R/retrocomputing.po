"Refers to emulations of way-behind-the-state-of-the-art hardware or "
"software, or implementations of never-was-state-of-the-art; esp. if such "
"implementations are elaborate practical jokes and/or parodies, written "
"mostly for :ref:`hack-value`\\, of more ‘serious’ designs. Perhaps the "
"most widely distributed retrocomputing utility was the :manpage:`pnch(6)`"
" or :manpage:`bcd(6)` program on V7 and other early Unix versions, which "
"would accept up to 80 characters of text argument and display the "
"corresponding pattern in :ref:`punched-card` code. Other well-known "
"retrocomputing hacks have included the programming language "
":ref:`INTERCAL`\\, a :ref:`JCL`\\-emulating shell for Unix, the card-"
"punch-emulating editor named 029, and various elaborate :ref:`PDP-11` "
"hardware emulators and RT-11 OS emulators written just to keep an old, "
"sourceless :ref:`Zork` binary running."
