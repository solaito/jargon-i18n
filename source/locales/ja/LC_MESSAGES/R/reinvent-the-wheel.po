"To design or implement a tool equivalent to an existing one or part of "
"one, with the implication that doing so is silly or a waste of time. This"
" is often a valid criticism. On the other hand, automobiles don't use "
"wooden rollers, and some kinds of wheel have to be reinvented many times "
"before you get them right. On the third hand, people reinventing the "
"wheel do tend to come up with the moral equivalent of a trapezoid with an"
" offset axle."
