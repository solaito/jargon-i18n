"[indirectly, from the book *Real Men Don't Eat Quiche*\\] A particular "
"sub-variety of hacker: one possessed of a flippant attitude toward "
"complexity that is arrogant even when justified by experience. The "
"archetypal Real Programmer likes to program on the :ref:`bare-metal` and "
"is very good at same, remembers the binary opcodes for every machine he "
"has ever programmed, thinks that HLLs are sissy, and uses a debugger to "
"edit his code because full-screen editors are for wimps. Real Programmers"
" aren't satisfied with code that hasn't been tuned into a state of "
":ref:`tense`\\ness just short of rupture. Real Programmers never use "
"comments or write documentation: \"If it was hard to write\", says the "
"Real Programmer, \"it should be hard to understand.\" Real Programmers "
"can make machines do things that were never in their spec sheets; in "
"fact, they are seldom really happy unless doing so. A Real Programmer's "
"code can awe with its fiendish brilliance, even as its crockishness "
"appalls. Real Programmers live on junk food and coffee, hang line-printer"
" art on their walls, and terrify the crap out of other programmers â€” "
"because someday, somebody else might have to try to understand their code"
" in order to change it. Their successors generally consider it a :ref"
":`Good-Thing` that there aren't many Real Programmers around any more. "
"For a famous (and somewhat more positive) portrait of a Real Programmer, "
"see :ref:`The Story of Mel'<story-of-mel>` in Appendix A. The term itself"
" was popularized by a letter to the editor in the July 1983 Datamation "
"titled *Real Programmers Don't Use Pascal* by Ed Post, still circulating "
"on Usenet and Internet in on-line form."
