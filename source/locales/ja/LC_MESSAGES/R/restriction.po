"A :ref:`bug` or design error that limits a program's capabilities, and "
"which is sufficiently egregious that nobody can quite work up enough "
"nerve to describe it as a :ref:`feature`\\. Often used (esp. by "
":ref:`marketroid` types) to make it sound as though some crippling "
"bogosity had been intended by the designers all along, or was forced upon"
" them by arcane technical constraints of a nature no mere user could "
"possibly comprehend (these claims are almost invariably false)."

"Old-time hacker Joseph M. Newcomer advises that whenever choosing a "
"quantifiable but arbitrary restriction, you should make it either a power"
" of 2 or a power of 2 minus 1. If you impose a limit of 107 items in a "
"list, everyone will know it is a random number â€” on the other hand, a "
"limit of 15 or 16 suggests some deep reason (involving 0- or 1-based "
"indexing in binary) and you will get less :ref:`flamage` for it. Limits "
"which are round numbers in base 10 are always especially suspect."
