"A hackish (and especially MIT) tradition is to choose "
"acronyms/abbreviations that refer humorously to themselves or to other "
"acronyms/abbreviations. The original of the breed may have been TINT "
"(\"TINT Is Not TECO\"). The classic examples were two MIT editors called "
"EINE (\"EINE Is Not EMACS\") and ZWEI (\"ZWEI Was EINE Initially\"). More"
" recently, there is a Scheme compiler called LIAR (Liar Imitates Apply "
"Recursively), and :ref:`GNU` (q.v., sense 1) stands for \"GNU's Not "
"Unix!\" — and a company with the name Cygnus, which expands to \"Cygnus, "
"Your GNU Support\" (though Cygnus people say this is a "
":ref:`backronym`\\). The GNU recursive acronym may have been patterned on"
" XINU, \"XINU Is Not Unix\" — a particularly nice example because it is a"
" mirror image, a backronym, and a recursive acronym. See also "
":ref:`mung`\\, :ref:`EMACS`\\."
