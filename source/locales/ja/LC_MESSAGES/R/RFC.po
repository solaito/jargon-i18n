"[Request For Comment] One of a long-es­tab­lished series of numbered "
"Internet informational documents and standards widely followed by "
"commercial software and freeware in the Internet and Unix communities. "
"Perhaps the single most influential one has been RFC-822 (the Internet "
"mail-format standard). The RFCs are unusual in that they are floated by "
"technical experts acting on their own initiative and reviewed by the "
"Internet at large, rather than formally promulgated through an "
"institution such as ANSI. For this reason, they remain known as RFCs even"
" once adopted as standards."

"The RFC tradition of pragmatic, experience-driven, after-the-fact "
"standard writing done by individuals or small working groups has "
"important advantages over the more formal, committee-driven process "
"typical of ANSI or ISO. Emblematic of some of these advantages is the "
"existence of a flourishing tradition of ‘joke’ RFCs; usually at least one"
" a year is published, usually on April 1st. Well-known joke RFCs have "
"included 527 (\"ARPAWOCKY\", R. Merryman, UCSD; 22 June 1973), 748 "
"(\"Telnet Randomly-Lose Option\", Mark R. Crispin; 1 April 1978), and "
"1149 (\"A Standard for the Transmission of IP Datagrams on Avian "
"Carriers\", D. Waitzman, BBN STC; 1 April 1990). The first was a Lewis "
"Carroll pastiche; the second a parody of the TCP-IP documentation style, "
"and the third a deadpan skewering of standards-document legalese, "
"describing protocols for transmitting Internet data packets by carrier "
"pigeon (since actually implemented; see Appendix A). See also :ref"
":`Infinite-Monkey-Theorem`\\."

"The RFCs are most remarkable for how well they work — they frequently "
"manage to have neither the ambiguities that are usually rife in informal "
"specifications, nor the committee-perpetrated misfeatures that often "
"haunt formal standards, and they define a network that has grown to truly"
" worldwide proportions."
