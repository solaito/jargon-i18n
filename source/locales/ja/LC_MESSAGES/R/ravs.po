"[primarily MIT/Boston usage] Jiao-zi (steamed or boiled) or Guo-tie (pan-"
"fried). A Chinese appetizer, known variously in the plural as dumplings, "
"pot stickers (the literal translation of guo-tie), and (around Boston) "
"‘Peking Ravioli’. The term rav is short for ‘ravioli’, and among hackers "
"always means the Chinese kind rather than the Italian kind. Both consist "
"of a filling in a pasta shell, but the Chinese kind includes no cheese, "
"uses a thinner pasta, has a pork-vegetable filling (good ones include "
"Chinese chives), and is cooked differently, either by steaming or frying."
" A rav or dumpling can be cooked any way, but a potsticker is always the "
"pan-fried kind (so called because it sticks to the frying pot and has to "
"be scraped off). \"Let's get hot-and-sour soup and three orders of "
"ravs.\" See also :ref:`oriental-food`\\."
