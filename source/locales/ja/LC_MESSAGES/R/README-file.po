"Hacker's-eye introduction traditionally included in the top-level "
"directory of a Unix source distribution, containing a pointer to more "
"detailed documentation, credits, miscellaneous revision history, notes, "
"etc. In the Mac and PC worlds, software is not usually distributed in "
"source form, and the README is more likely to contain user-oriented "
"material like last-minute documentation changes, error workarounds, and "
"restrictions. When asked, hackers invariably relate the README convention"
" to the famous scene in Lewis Carroll's *Alice's Adventures In "
"Wonderland* in which Alice confronts magic munchies labeled \"Eat Me\" "
"and \"Drink Me\"."

"The file may be named README, or READ.ME, or rarely ReadMe or readme.txt "
"or some other variant. The all-upper-case spellings, however, are "
"universal among Unix programmers. By ancient tradition, real source files"
" have all-lowercase names and all-uppercase is reserved for metadata, "
"comments, and grafitti. This is functional; because 'A' sorts before 'a' "
"in ASCII, the README will appear in directory listings before any source "
"file."
