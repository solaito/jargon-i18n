"A :ref:`hack` or :ref:`crock` that depends on a complex combination of "
"coincidences (or, possibly, the combination upon which the crock depends "
"for its accidental failure to malfunction). \"This hack can output "
"characters 40--57 by putting the character in the four-bit accumulator "
"field of an XCT and then extracting six bits â€” the low 2 bits of the XCT "
"opcode are the right thing.\" \"What randomness!\""

"Of people, synonymous with flakiness. The connotation is that the person "
"so described is behaving weirdly, incompetently, or inappropriately for "
"reasons which are (a) too tiresome to bother inquiring into, (b) are "
"probably as inscrutable as quantum phenomena anyway, and (c) are likely "
"to pass with time. \"Maybe he has a real complaint, or maybe it's just "
"randomness. See if he calls back.\""

"Despite the negative connotations of most jargon uses of this term have, "
"it is worth noting that randomness can actually be a valuable resource, "
"very useful for applications in cryptography and elsewhere. Computers are"
" so thoroughly deterministic that they have a hard time generating high-"
"quality randomness, so hackers have sometimes felt the need to built "
"special-purpose contraptions for this purpose alone. One well-known "
"website offers random bits `generated by radioactive decay "
"<http://www.fourmilab.ch/hotbits/>`_. Another derives random bits from "
"`chaotic systems <http://lavarnd.org/>`_\\  in analog electronics. "
"Originally, the latter site got its random bits by doing photometry on "
"lava lamps. Hackers invariably found this hilarious. If you have to ask "
"why, you'll never get it.)"
