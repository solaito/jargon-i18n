"n\\. The common situation in pulp fiction (esp. comics or soap operas) "
"where a new story ‘reveals’ things about events in previous stories, "
"usually leaving the ‘facts’ the same (thus preserving continuity) while "
"completely changing their interpretation. For example, revealing that a "
"whole season of *Dallas* was a dream was a retcon."

"independently in use in comics fandom before :samp:`rec.arts.comics`\\, "
"and have citations from around 1981. In lexicography, nothing is ever "
"simple. —ESR]"
