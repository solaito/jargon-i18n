"[From the :ref:`Dilbert` comic strip of November 14, 1995] A :ref"
":`hacking-run` that produces results which, while superficially coherent,"
" have little or nothing to do with its original objectives. There are "
"strong connotations that the coding process and the objectives themselves"
" were pretty :ref:`random`\\. (In the original comic strip, the Ratbert "
"is invited to dance on Dilbert's keyboard in order to produce bugs for "
"him to fix, and authors a Web browser instead.) Compare :ref:`Infinite-"
"Monkey-Theorem`\\."

"This term seems to have become widely recognized quite rapidly after the "
"original strip, a fact which testifies to Dilbert's huge popularity among"
" hackers. All too many find the perverse incentives and Kafkaesque "
"atmosphere of Dilbert's mythical workplace reflective of their own "
"experiences."
