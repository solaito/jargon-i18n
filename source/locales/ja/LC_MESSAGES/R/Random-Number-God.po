"[rec.games.roguelike.angband; often abbreviated ‘RNG’] The malign force "
"which lurks behind the random number generator in :ref:`Angband` (and by "
"extension elsewhere). A dark god that demands sacrifices and toys with "
"its victims. \"I just found a really great item; I suppose the RNG is "
"about to punish me...\" Apparently, Angband's random number generator "
"occasionally gets locked in a repetition, so you get something with a 3% "
"chance happening 8 times in a row. Improbable, but far too common to be "
"pure chance. Compare :ref:`Shub-Internet`\\."
