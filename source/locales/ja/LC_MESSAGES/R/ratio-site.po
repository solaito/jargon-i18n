"[warez d00dz] An FTP site storing pirated files where one must first "
"upload something before being able to download. There is a ratio, based "
"on bytes or files count, between the uploads and download. For instance, "
"on a 2:1 site, to download a 4 Mb file, one must first upload at least 2 "
"Mb of files. The hotter the contents of the server are, the smaller the "
"ratio is. More often than not, the server refuses uploads because its "
"disk is full, making it useless for downloading â€” or the connection "
"magically breaks after one has uploaded a large amount of files, just "
"before the downloading phase begins. See also :ref:`banner-site`\\, :ref"
":`leech-mode`\\."
