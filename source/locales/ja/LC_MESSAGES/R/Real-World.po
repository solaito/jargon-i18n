"Those institutions at which ‘programming’ may be used in the same "
"sentence as ‘FORTRAN’, ‘ :ref:`COBOL`\\’, ‘RPG’, ‘ :ref:`IBM`\\’, "
"‘DBASE’, etc. Places where programs do such commercially necessary but "
"intellectually uninspiring things as generating payroll checks and "
"invoices."

"Anywhere outside a university. \"Poor fellow, he's left MIT and gone into"
" the Real World.\" Used pejoratively by those not in residence there. In "
"conversation, talking of someone who has entered the Real World is not "
"unlike speaking of a deceased person. It is also noteworthy that on the "
"campus of Cambridge University in England, there is a gaily-painted lamp-"
"post which bears the label ‘REALITY CHECKPOINT’. It marks the boundary "
"between university and the Real World; check your notions of reality "
"before passing. This joke is funnier because the Cambridge ‘campus’ is "
"actually coextensive with the center of Cambridge town. See also :ref"
":`fear-and-loathing`\\, :ref:`mundane`\\, and :ref:`uninteresting`\\."
