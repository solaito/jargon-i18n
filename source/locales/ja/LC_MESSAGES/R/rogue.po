"[Unix] n. A Dungeons-and-Dragons-like game using character graphics, "
"written under BSD Unix and subsequently ported to other Unix systems. The"
" original BSD :manpage:`curses(3)` screen-handling package was hacked "
"together by Ken Arnold primarily to support games, and the development of"
" :manpage:`rogue(6)` popularized its use; it has since become one of "
"Unix's most important and heavily used application libraries. Nethack, "
"Omega, Larn, Angband, and an entire subgenre of computer dungeon games "
"(all known as ‘roguelikes’) all took off from the inspiration provided by"
" :manpage:`rogue(6)`\\; the popular Windows game Diablo, though graphics-"
"intensive, has very similar play logic. See also :ref:`nethack`\\, "
":ref:`moria`\\, :ref:`Angband`\\."

"of :ref:`spam`\\ming) by its customers, or which itself engages in such "

":ref:`UDP`\\s. Sometimes deliberately misspelled as \"rouge\"."
