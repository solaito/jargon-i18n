"The surprisingly large amount of work that needs to be done as the result"
" of any small but globally visible program change. \"The world\" may mean"
" the entirety of some huge program, or may in theory refer to every "
"program of a certain class in the entire known universe. For instance, "
"\"Add one #define to stdio.h, and you have to recompile the world.\" This"
" means that any minor change to the standard-I/O header file "
"theoretically mandates recompiling every C program in existence, even if "
"only to verify that the change didn't screw something else up. In "
"practice, you may not actually have to recompile the world, but the "
"implication is that some human cleverness is required to figure out what "
"parts can be safely left out."
