"[Case Western Reserve University] Yet another hackish parody religion "
"(see also :ref:`Church-of-the-SubGenius`\\, :ref:`Discordianism`\\). In "
"the mid-70s, the canonical \"Introduction to Programming\" courses at "
"CWRU were taught in Algol, and student exercises were punched on cards "
"and run on a Univac 1108 system using a homebrew operating system named "
"CHI. The religion had no doctrines and but one ritual: whenever the "
"worshiper noted that a digital clock read 11:08, he or she would recite "
"the phrase \"It is 11:08; ABS, ALPHABETIC, ARCSIN, ARCCOS, ARCTAN.\" The "
"last five words were the first five functions in the appropriate chapter "
"of the Algol manual; note the special pronunciations /obz/ and /ark´sin/ "
"rather than the more common /ahbz/ and /ark´si:n/. Using an alarm clock "
"to warn of 11:08's arrival was :ref:`considered-harmful`\\."
