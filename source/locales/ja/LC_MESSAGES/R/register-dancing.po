"Many older processor architectures suffer from a serious shortage of "
"general-purpose registers. This is especially a problem for compiler-"
"writers, because their generated code needs places to store temporaries "
"for things like intermediate values in expression evaluation. Some "
"designs with this problem, like the Intel 80x86, do have a handful of "
"special-purpose registers that can be pressed into service, providing "
"suitable care is taken to avoid unpleasant side effects on the state of "
"the processor: while the special-purpose register is being used to hold "
"an intermediate value, a delicate minuet is required in which the "
"previous value of the register is saved and then restored just before the"
" official function (and value) of the special-purpose register is again "
"needed."
