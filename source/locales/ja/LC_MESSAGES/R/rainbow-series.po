"Any of several series of technical manuals distinguished by cover color. "
"The original rainbow series was the NCSC security manuals (see :ref"
":`Orange-Book`\\). These are now available `via the web "
"<http://www.radium.ncsc.mil/tpep/library/rainbow/>`_. the term has also "
"been commonly applied to the PostScript reference set. Which books are "
"meant by \"the rainbow series\" unqualified is thus dependent on one's "
"local technical culture."
