"[techspeak] adj. Describes an application which requires a program to "
"respond to stimuli within some small upper limit of response time "
"(typically milli- or microseconds). Process control at a chemical plant "

"operating systems (because everything else must take a back seat to "
"response time) and speed-tuned hardware."
