"[sci.crypt newsgroup] The technique of breaking a code or cipher by "
"finding someone who has the key and applying a rubber hose vigorously and"
" repeatedly to the soles of that luckless person's feet until the key is "
"discovered. Shorthand for any method of coercion: the originator of the "
"term drily noted that it \"can take a surprisingly short time and is "
"quite computationally inexpensive\" relative to other cryptanalysis "
"methods. Compare :ref:`social-engineering`\\, :ref:`brute-force`\\."
