"Abbreviation: \"Realtime Blackhole List\". A service that allows people "
"to blacklist sites for emitting :ref:`spam`\\, and makes the blacklist "
"available in real time to electronic-mail transport programs that know "
"how to use RBL so they can filter out mail from those sites. Drastic (and"
" controversial) but effective. There is an `RBL home page <http://mail-"
"abuse.org/rbl/usage.html>`_."
