"Hackerdom is still predominantly male. However, the percentage of women "
"is clearly higher than the low-single-digit range typical for technical "
"professions, and female hackers are generally respected and dealt with as"
" equals."

"In the U.S., hackerdom is predominantly Caucasian with strong minorities "
"of Jews (East Coast) and Orientals (West Coast). The Jewish contingent "
"has exerted a particularly pervasive cultural influence (see "
":ref:`Food<food>`\\, above, and note that several common jargon terms are"
" obviously mutated Yiddish)."

"The ethnic distribution of hackers is understood by them to be a function"
" of which ethnic groups tend to seek and value education. Racial and "
"ethnic prejudice is notably uncommon and tends to be met with freezing "
"contempt."

"When asked, hackers often ascribe their culture's gender- and color-"
"blindness to a positive effect of text-only network channels, and this is"
" doubtless a powerful influence. Also, the ties many hackers have to AI "
"research and SF literature may have helped them to develop an idea of "
"personhood that is inclusive rather than exclusive â€” after all, if one's "
"imagination readily grants full human rights to future AI programs, "
"robots, dolphins, and extraterrestrial aliens, mere color and gender "
"can't seem very important any more."
