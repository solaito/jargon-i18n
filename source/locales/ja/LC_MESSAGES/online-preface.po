"This document (the Jargon File) is in the public domain, to be freely "
"used, shared, and modified. There are (by intention) no legal restraints "
"on what you can do with it, but there are traditions about its proper use"
" to which many hackers are quite strongly attached. Please extend the "
"courtesy of proper citation when you quote the File, ideally with a "
"version number, as it will change and grow over time. (Examples of "
"appropriate citation form: \"Jargon File 4.4.7\" or \"The on-line hacker "
"Jargon File, version 4.4.7, 29 Dec 2003\".)"

"maintaining the File and been recognized by the net at large as editors "
"of it. Editorial responsibilities include: to collate contributions and "
"suggestions from others; to seek out corroborating information; to cross-"
"reference related entries; to keep the file in a consistent format; and "
"to announce and distribute updated versions periodically. Current "
