":ref:`C`\\, :ref:`Perl`\\, :ref:`Python`\\, :ref:`Java` and :ref:`LISP` â€”"
" the dominant languages in open-source development. This list has changed"
" over time, but slowly. Java bumped C++ off of it, and Python appears to "
"be recruiting people who would otherwise gravitate to LISP (which used to"
" be much more important than it is now). Smalltalk and Prolog are also "
"popular in small but influential communities."

"The :ref:`Real-Programmer`\\s who loved FORTRAN and assembler have pretty"
" much all retired or died since 1990. Assembler is generally no longer "
"considered interesting or appropriate for anything but :ref:`HLL` "
"implementation, :ref:`glue`\\, and a few time-critical and hardware-"
"specific uses in systems programs. FORTRAN occupies a shrinking niche in "
"scientific programming."

"Most hackers tend to frown on languages like :ref:`Pascal` and Ada, which"
" don't give them the near-total freedom considered necessary for hacking "
"(see :ref:`bondage-and-discipline-language`\\), and to regard everything "
"even remotely connected with :ref:`COBOL` or other traditional :ref:`DP` "
"languages as a total and unmitigated :ref:`loss`\\."
