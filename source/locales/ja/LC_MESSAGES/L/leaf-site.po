"[obs.] Before pervasive TCP/IP, this term was used of a machine that "
"merely originated and read Usenet news or mail, and did not relay any "
"third-party traffic. It was often uttered in a critical tone; when the "
"ratio of leaf sites to backbone, rib, and other relay sites got too high,"
" the network tended to develop bottlenecks. Compare :ref:`backbone-"
"site`\\. Now that traffic patterns depend more on the distribution of "
"routers than of host machines this term has largely fallen out of use."
