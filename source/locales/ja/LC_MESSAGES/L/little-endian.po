"Describes a computer architecture in which, within a given 16- or 32-bit "
"word, bytes at lower addresses have lower significance (the word is "
"stored ‘little-end-first’). The :ref:`PDP-11` and :ref:`VAX` families of "
"computers and Intel microprocessors and a lot of communications and "
"networking hardware are little-endian. See :ref:`big-endian`\\, :ref"
":`middle-endian`\\, :ref:`NUXI-problem`\\. The term is sometimes used to "
"describe the ordering of units other than bytes; most often, bits within "
"a byte."
