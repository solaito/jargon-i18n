"[techspeak] Spurious characters due to electrical noise in a "
"communications link, especially an RS-232 serial connection. Line noise "
"may be induced by poor connections, interference or crosstalk from other "
"circuits, electrical storms, :ref:`cosmic-rays`\\, or (notionally) birds "
"crapping on the phone wires."

"Text that is theoretically a readable text or program source but employs "
"syntax so bizarre that it looks like line noise in senses 1 or 2. Yes, "
"there are languages this ugly. The canonical example is :ref:`TECO`\\; it"
" is often claimed that \"TECO's input syntax is indistinguishable from "
"line noise.\" Other non- :ref:`WYSIWYG` editors, such as Multics "
":code:`qed` and Unix :code:`ed`\\, in the hands of a real hacker, also "
"qualify easily, as do deliberately obfuscated languages such as "
":ref:`INTERCAL`\\."
