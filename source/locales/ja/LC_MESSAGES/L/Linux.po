"The free Unix workalike created by Linus Torvalds and friends starting "
"about 1991. The pronunciation /li´nuhks/ is preferred because the name "
"‘Linus’ has an /ee/ sound in Swedish (Linus's family is part of Finland's"
" 6% ethnic-Swedish minority) and Linus considers English short /i/ to be "
"closer to /ee/ than English long /i:/. This may be the most remarkable "
"hacker project in history — an entire clone of Unix for 386, 486 and "
"Pentium micros, distributed for free with sources over the net (ports to "
"Alpha and Sparc and many other machines are also in use)."

"Linux is what :ref:`GNU` aimed to be, and it relies on the GNU toolset. "
"But the Free Software Foundation didn't produce the kernel to go with "
"that toolset until 1999, which was too late. Other, similar efforts like "
"FreeBSD and NetBSD have been technically successful but never caught fire"
" the way Linux has; as this is written in 2003, Linux has effectively "
"swallowed all proprietary Unixes except Solaris and is seriously "
"challenging Microsoft. It has already captured 41% of the Internet-server"
" market and over 25% of general business servers."

"An earlier version of this entry opined \"The secret of Linux's success "
"seems to be that Linus worked much harder early on to keep the "
"development process open and recruit other hackers, creating a snowball "
"effect.\" Truer than we knew. See :ref:`bazaar`\\."

"(Some people object that the name ‘Linux’ should be used to refer only to"
" the kernel, not the entire operating system. This claim is a proxy for "
"an underlying territorial dispute; people who insist on the term "
"GNU/Linux want the :ref:`FSF` to get most of the credit for Linux because"
" RMS and friends wrote many of its user-level tools. Neither this theory "
"nor the term GNU/Linux has gained more than minority acceptance)."
