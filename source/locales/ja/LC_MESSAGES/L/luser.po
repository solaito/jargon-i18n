"[common] A :ref:`user`\\; esp. one who is also a :ref:`loser`\\. ( "
":ref:`luser` and :ref:`loser` are pronounced identically.) This word was "
"coined around 1975 at MIT. Under ITS, when you first walked up to a "
"terminal at MIT and typed Control-Z to get the computer's attention, it "
"printed out some status information, including how many people were "
"already using the computer; it might print \"14 users\", for example. "
"Someone thought it would be a great joke to patch the system to print "
"\"14 losers\" instead. There ensued a great controversy, as some of the "
"users didn't particularly want to be called losers to their faces every "
"time they used the computer. For a while several hackers struggled "
"covertly, each changing the message behind the back of the others; any "
"time you logged into the computer it was even money whether it would say "
"\"users\" or \"losers\". Finally, someone tried the compromise "
"\"lusers\", and it stuck. Later one of the ITS machines supported "
":code:`luser` as a request-for-help command. ITS died the death in "
"mid-1990, except as a museum piece; the usage lives on, however, and the "
"term luser is often seen in program comments and on Usenet. Compare "
":ref:`mundane`\\, :ref:`muggle`\\, :ref:`newbie`\\, :ref:`chainik`\\."
