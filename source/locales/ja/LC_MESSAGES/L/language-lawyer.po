"A person, usually an experienced or senior software engineer, who is "
"intimately familiar with many or most of the numerous restrictions and "
"features (both useful and esoteric) applicable to one or more computer "
"programming languages. A language lawyer is distinguished by the ability "
"to show you the five sentences scattered through a 200-plus-page manual "
"that together imply the answer to your question \"if only you had thought"
" to look there\". Compare :ref:`wizard`\\, :ref:`legal`\\, "
":ref:`legalese`\\."
