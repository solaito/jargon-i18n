"*Source Code and Commentary on Unix level 6*\\, by John Lions. The two "
"parts of this book contained (1) the entire source listing of the Unix "
"Version 6 kernel, and (2) a commentary on the source discussing the "
"algorithms. These were circulated internally at the University of New "
"South Wales beginning 1976--77, and were, for years after, the *only* "
"detailed kernel documentation available to anyone outside Bell Labs. "
"Because Western Electric wished to maintain trade secret status on the "
"kernel, the Lions Book was only supposed to be distributed to affiliates "
"of source licensees. In spite of this, it soon spread by :ref:`samizdat` "
"to a good many of the early Unix hackers."

"ISBN 1-57398-013-7 from Peer-To-Peer Communications, with forewords by "
"Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson. In a neat bit of reflexivity, the page "
"before the contents quotes this entry.]"
