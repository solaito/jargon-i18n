"[Usenet] A bug in some now-obsolete versions of the netnews software that"
" used to eat up to BUFSIZ bytes of the article text. The bug was "
"triggered by having the text of the article start with a space or tab. "
"This bug was quickly personified as a mythical creature called the line "
"eater, and postings often included a dummy line of line eater food. "
"Ironically, line eater ‘food’ not beginning with a space or tab wasn't "
"actually eaten, since the bug was avoided; but if there *was* a space or "
"tab before it, then the line eater would eat the food *and* the beginning"
" of the text it was supposed to be protecting. The practice of "
"sacrificing to the line eater continued for some time after the bug had "
"been :ref:`nailed-to-the-wall`\\, and is still humorously referred to. "
"The bug itself was still occasionally reported to be lurking in some "
"mail-to-netnews gateways as late as 1991."
