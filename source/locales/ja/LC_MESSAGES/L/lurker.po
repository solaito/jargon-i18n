"One of the ‘silent majority’ in an electronic forum; one who posts "
"occasionally or not at all but is known to read the group's postings "
"regularly. This term is not pejorative and indeed is casually used "
"reflexively: \"Oh, I'm just lurking.\" Often used in the lurkers, the "
"hypothetical audience for the group's :ref:`flamage`\\-emitting regulars."
" When a lurker speaks up for the first time, this is called delurking."
