"A cellular-automata game invented by John Horton Conway and first "
"introduced publicly by Martin Gardner (*Scientific American*\\, October "
"1970); the game's popularity had to wait a few years for computers on "
"which it could reasonably be played, as it's no fun to simulate the cells"
" by hand. Many hackers pass through a stage of fascination with it, and "
"hackers at various places contributed heavily to the mathematical "
"analysis of this game (most notably Bill Gosper at MIT, who even "
"implemented life in :ref:`TECO`\\!). When a hacker mentions ‘life’, he is"
" much more likely to mean this game than the magazine, the breakfast "
"cereal, or the human state of existence. Many web resources are available"
" starting from the `Open Directory page of Life "
"<http://dmoz.org/Computers/Artificial_Life/Cellular_Automata/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life/>`_."
" The `Life Lexicon <http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_home.htm>`_\\"
"  is a good indicator of what makes the game so fascinating."
