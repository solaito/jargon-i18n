"n\\. A piece of :ref:`email` containing :ref:`live-data` intended to do "
"nefarious things to the recipient's machine or terminal. It used to be "
"possible, for example, to send letterbombs that would lock up some "
"specific kinds of terminals when they are viewed, so thoroughly that the "
"user must cycle power (see :ref:`cycle`\\, sense 3) to unwedge them. "
"Under Unix, a letterbomb can also try to get part of its contents "
"interpreted as a shell command to the mailer. The results of this could "
"range from silly to tragic; fortunately it has been some years since any "
"of the standard Unix/Internet mail software was vulnerable to such an "
"attack (though, as the Melissa virus attack demonstrated in early 1999, "
"Microsoft systems can have serious problems). See also :ref:`Trojan-"
"horse`\\; compare :ref:`nastygram`\\."
