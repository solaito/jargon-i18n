"Too small to be worth considering; more specifically, small beyond the "
"limits of accuracy or measurement. This is a reference to floating "
"underflow, a condition that can occur when a floating-point arithmetic "
"processor tries to handle quantities smaller than its limit of magnitude."
" It is also a pun on ‘undertow’ (a kind of fast, cold current that "
"sometimes runs just offshore and can be dangerous to swimmers). \"Well, "
"sure, photon pressure from the stadium lights alters the path of a thrown"
" baseball, but that effect gets lost in the underflow.\" Compare "
":ref:`epsilon`\\, :ref:`epsilon-squared`\\; see also :ref:`overflow-"
"bit`\\."
