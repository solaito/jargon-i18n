"[from ‘LISt Processing language’, but mythically from ‘Lots of Irritating"
" Superfluous Parentheses’] AI's mother tongue, a language based on the "
"ideas of (a) variable-length lists and trees as fundamental data types, "
"and (b) the interpretation of code as data and vice-versa. Invented by "
"John McCarthy at MIT in the late 1950s, it is actually older than any "
"other :ref:`HLL` still in use except FORTRAN. Accordingly, it has "
"undergone considerable adaptive radiation over the years; modern variants"
" are quite different in detail from the original LISP 1.5. The dominant "
"HLL among hackers until the early 1980s, LISP has since shared the throne"
" with :ref:`C`\\. Its partisans claim it is the only language that is "
"truly beautiful. See :ref:`languages-of-choice`\\."

"All LISP functions and programs are expressions that return values; this,"
" together with the high memory utilization of LISPs, gave rise to Alan "
"Perlis's famous quip (itself a take on an Oscar Wilde quote) that \"LISP "
"programmers know the value of everything and the cost of nothing\"."

"One significant application for LISP has been as a proof by example that "
"most newer languages, such as :ref:`COBOL` and Ada, are full of "
"unnecessary :ref:`crock`\\s. When the :ref:`Right-Thing` has already been"
" done once, there is no justification for :ref:`bogosity` in newer "
"languages."
