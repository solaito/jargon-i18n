"An event to which several users bring their boxes and hook them up to a "
"common LAN (Local Area Network), often for the purpose of playing "
"multiplayer computer games, especially action games such as Quake or "
"Unreal Tournament. This is also a good venue for people to show-off their"
" fancy new hardware. Such events can get pretty large, several hundred "
"people attend the annual QuakeCon in Texas. The theoretical rationale "
"behind LAN parties is that playing over the Internet often introduces too"
" much lag in the playing experience — but just as important is the "
"special quality of trash-talking each other across the room while "
"playing, and the instinctive social ritual of consuming vast amounts of "
"food and drink together."
