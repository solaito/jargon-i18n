"[Unix] A directory tree that contains many links to files in a master "
"directory tree of files. Link farms save space when one is maintaining "
"several nearly identical copies of the same source tree â€” for example, "
"when the only difference is architecture-dependent object files. \"Let's "
"freeze the source and then rebuild the FROBOZZ-3 and FROBOZZ-4 link "
"farms.\" Link farms may also be used to get around restrictions on the "
"number of :code:`-I` (include-file directory) arguments on older C "
"preprocessors. However, they can also get completely out of hand, "
"becoming the filesystem equivalent of :ref:`spaghetti-code`\\. See also "
":ref:`farm`\\."
