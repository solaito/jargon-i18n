"A slogan associated with Unix in the romantic days when Unix aficionados "
"saw themselves as a tiny, beleaguered underground tilting against the "
"windmills of industry. The \"free\" referred specifically to freedom from"
" the :ref:`fascist` design philosophies and crufty misfeatures common on "
"competing operating systems. Armando Stettner, one of the early Unix "
"developers, used to give out fake license plates bearing this motto under"
" a large Unix, all in New Hampshire colors of green and white. These are "
"now valued collector's items. In 1994 :ref:`DEC` put an inferior "
"imitation of these in circulation with a red corporate logo added. Compaq"
" (half of which was once DEC) continued the practice."
