"Something (not a person) that loses; a situation in which something is "
"losing. Emphatic forms include moby loss, and total loss, complete loss. "
"Common interjections are \"What a loss!\" and \"What a moby loss!\" Note "
"that moby loss is OK even though \\*\\*moby loser is not used; applied to"
" an abstract noun, moby is simply a magnifier, whereas when applied to a "
"person it implies substance and has positive connotations. Compare "
":ref:`lossage`\\."
