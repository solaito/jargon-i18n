"Crackers also use it to refer to cracker :ref:`wannabee`\\s. In phreak "
"culture, a lamer is one who scams codes off others rather than doing "
"cracks or really understanding the fundamental concepts. In :ref:`warez-"
"d00dz` culture, where the ability to wave around cracked commercial "
"software within days of (or before) release to the commercial market is "
"much esteemed, the lamer might try to upload garbage or shareware or "
"something incredibly old (old in this context is read as a few years to "
"anything older than 3 days). ‘Lamer’ is also much used in the IRC world "
"in a similar sense to the above."

"This term seems to have originated in the Commodore-64 scene in the mid "
"1980s. It was popularized among Amiga crackers of the mid-1980s by ‘Lamer"
" Exterminator’, the most famous and feared Amiga virus ever, which "
"gradually corrupted non-write-protected floppy disks with bad sectors. "
"The bad sectors, when looked at, were overwritten with repetitions of the"
" string \"LAMER! \"."
