"[IBM] Middle management or HQ staff (or, by extension, administrative "
"drones in general). From an old joke about two lions who, escaping from "
"the zoo, split up to increase their chances but agree to meet after 2 "
"months. When they finally meet, one is skinny and the other overweight. "
"The thin one says: \"How did you manage? I ate a human just once and they"
" turned out a small army to chase me â€” guns, nets, it was terrible. Since"
" then I've been reduced to eating mice, insects, even grass.\" The fat "
"one replies: \"Well, I hid near an IBM office and ate a manager a day. "
"And nobody even noticed!\""
