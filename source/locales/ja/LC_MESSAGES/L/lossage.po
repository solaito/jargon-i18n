"[very common] The result of a bug or malfunction. This is a mass or "
"collective noun. \"What a loss!\" and \"What lossage!\" are nearly "
"synonymous. The former is slightly more particular to the speaker's "
"present circumstances; the latter implies a continuing :ref:`lose` of "
"which the speaker is currently a victim. Thus (for example) a temporary "
"hardware failure is a loss, but bugs in an important tool (like a "
"compiler) are serious lossage."
