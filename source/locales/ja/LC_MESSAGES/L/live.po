"[common] Opposite of ‘test’. Refers to actual real-world data or a "
"program working with it. For example, the response to \"I think the "
"record deleter is finished\" might be \"Is it live yet?\" or \"Have you "
"tried it out on live data?\" This usage usually carries the connotation "
"that live data is more fragile and must not be corrupted, or bad things "
"will happen. So a more appropriate response might be: \"Well, make sure "
"it works perfectly before we throw live data at it.\" The implication "
"here is that record deletion is something pretty significant, and a "
"haywire record-deleter running amok live would probably cause great harm."
