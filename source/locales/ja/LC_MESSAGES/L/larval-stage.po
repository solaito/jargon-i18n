"Describes a period of monomaniacal concentration on coding apparently "
"passed through by all fledgling hackers. Common symptoms include the "
"perpetration of more than one 36-hour :ref:`hacking-run` in a given week;"
" neglect of all other activities including usual basics like food, sleep,"
" and personal hygiene; and a chronic case of advanced bleary-eye. Can "
"last from 6 months to 2 years, the apparent median being around 18 "
"months. A few so afflicted never resume a more ‘normal’ life, but the "
"ordeal seems to be necessary to produce really wizardly (as opposed to "
"merely competent) programmers. See also :ref:`wannabee`\\. A less "
"protracted and intense version of larval stage (typically lasting about a"
" month) may recur when one is learning a new :ref:`OS` or programming "
"language."
