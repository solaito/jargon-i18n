"The Internet's first poster girl, a standard test load used in the image "
"processing community. The image was originally cropped from the November "
"1972 issue of *Playboy Magazine*\\, which anglicized the model's name "
"with a double n. It has interesting properties — complex feathers, "
"shadows, smooth (but not flat) surfaces — that are pertinent in "
"demonstrating various processing algorithms for image compression, "
"filtering, dithering, texture mapping, image recognition, and so on. "
"After a quarter century of remaining completely unaware that she had "
"become an icon, a gray-haired but still winsome Lenna finally met her "
"fans at a computer graphics conference in 1997. There is a fan page at "
"`www.lenna.org <http://www.lenna.org>`_, with more details. Compare :ref"
":`Utah-teapot` and :ref:`Stanford-Bunny`"
