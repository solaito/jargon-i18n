"Loosely used to mean ‘in accordance with all the relevant rules’, esp. in"
" connection with some set of constraints defined by software. \"The older"
" =+ alternate for += is no longer legal syntax in ANSI C.\" \"This parser"
" processes each line of legal input the moment it sees the trailing "
"linefeed.\" Hackers often model their work as a sort of game played with "
"the environment in which the objective is to maneuver through the thicket"
" of ‘natural laws’ to achieve a desired objective. Their use of legal is "
"flavored as much by this game-playing sense as by the more conventional "
"one having to do with courts and lawyers. Compare :ref:`language-"
"lawyer`\\, :ref:`legalese`\\."
