"A mythical conspiracy accused by :ref:`spam`\\-spewers of funding anti-"
"spam activism in order to force the direct-mail promotions industry back "
"onto paper. Hackers, predictably, responded by forming a \"Lumber "
"Cartel\" spoofing this paranoid theory; the web page is "
"`http://come.to/the.lumber.cartel/ <http://come.to/the.lumber.cartel/>`_."
" Members often include the tag TINLC (\"There Is No Lumber Cartel\") in "
"their postings; see :ref:`TINC`\\, :ref:`backbone-cabal` and :ref:`NANA` "
"for explanation."
