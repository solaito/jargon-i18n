"[MUD] The state a player is in when they kill their connection to a "
":ref:`MUD` without leaving it properly. The player is then commonly left "
"as a statue in the game, and is only removed after a certain period of "
"time (an hour on most MUDs). Used on :ref:`IRC` as well, although it is "
"inappropriate in that context. Compare :ref:`netdead`\\."
