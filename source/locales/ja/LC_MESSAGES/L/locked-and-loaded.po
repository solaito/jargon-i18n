"[from military slang for an M-16 rifle with magazine inserted and "
"prepared for firing] Said of a removable disk volume properly prepared "
"for use — that is, locked into the drive and with the heads loaded. "
"Ironically, because their heads are ‘loaded’ whenever the power is up, "
"this description is never used of :ref:`Winchester` drives (which are "
"named after a rifle)."
