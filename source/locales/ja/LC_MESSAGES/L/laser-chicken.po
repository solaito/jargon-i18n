"Kung Pao Chicken, a standard Chinese dish containing chicken, peanuts, "
"and hot red peppers in a spicy pepper-oil sauce. Many hackers call it "
"laser chicken for two reasons: It can :ref:`zap` you just like a laser, "
"and the sauce has a red color reminiscent of some laser beams. The dish "
"has also been called gunpowder chicken."

"In a variation on this theme, it is reported that some Australian hackers"
" have redesignated the common dish ‘lemon chicken’ as Chernobyl Chicken. "
"The name is derived from the color of the sauce, which is considered "
"bright enough to glow in the dark (as, mythically, do some of the "
"inhabitants of Chernobyl)."
