"n\\. (Also leecher.) Among BBS types, crackers and :ref:`warez-d00dz`\\, "
"one who consumes knowledge without generating new software, cracks, or "
"techniques. BBS culture specifically defines a leech as someone who "
"downloads files with few or no uploads in return, and who does not "
"contribute to the message section. Cracker culture extends this "
"definition to someone (a :ref:`lamer`\\, usually) who constantly presses "
"informed sources for information and/or assistance, but has nothing to "
"contribute. See :ref:`troughie`\\."

"v\\. [common, Toronto area] v. To download a file across any kind of "
"internet link. \"Hop on IRC later so I can leech some MP3s from you.\" "
"Used to describe activities ranging from FTP, to IRC DCC-send, to ICQ "
"file requests, to Napster searches (but never to downloading email with "
"file attachments; the implication is that the download is the result of a"
" browse or search of some sort of file server). Seems to be a holdover "
"from the early 1990s when Toronto had a very active BBS and warez scene. "
"Synonymous with :ref:`snarf` (sense 2), and contrast :ref:`snarf` (sense "
"4)."
