"[from the technical term logical device, wherein a physical device is "
"referred to by an arbitrary ‘logical’ name] Having the role of. If a "
"person (say, Les Earnest at SAIL) who had long held a certain post left "
"and were replaced, the replacement would for a while be known as the "
"logical Les Earnest. (This does not imply any judgment on the "
"replacement.) Compare :ref:`virtual`\\."

"At Stanford, ‘logical’ compass directions denote a coordinate system "
"relative to El Camino Real, in which ‘logical north’ is always toward San"
" Francisco and ‘logical south’ is always toward San Jose--in spite of the"
" fact that El Camino Real runs physical north/south near San Francisco, "
"physical east/west near San Jose, and along a curve everywhere in "
"between. (The best rule of thumb here is that, by definition, El Camino "
"Real always runs logical north-south.)"

"In giving directions, one might say: \"To get to Rincon Tarasco "
"restaurant, get onto :ref:`El-Camino-Bignum` going logical north.\" Using"
" the word ‘logical’ helps to prevent the recipient from worrying about "
"that the fact that the sun is setting almost directly in front of him. "
"The concept is reinforced by North American highways which are almost, "
"but not quite, consistently labeled with logical rather than physical "
"directions. A similar situation exists at MIT: Route 128 (famous for the "
"electronics industry that grew up along it) wraps roughly 3 quarters "
"around Boston at a radius of 10 miles, terminating near the coastline at "
"each end. It would be most precise to describe the two directions along "
"this highway as ‘clockwise’ and ‘counterclockwise’, but the road signs "
"all say \"north\" and \"south\", respectively. A hacker might describe "
"these directions as logical north and logical south, to indicate that "
"they are conventional directions not corresponding to the usual "
"denotation for those words."
