"Dense, pedantic verbiage in a language description, product "
"specification, or interface standard; text that seems designed to "
"obfuscate and requires a :ref:`language-lawyer` to :ref:`parse` it. "
"Though hackers are not afraid of high information density and complexity "
"in language (indeed, they rather enjoy both), they share a deep and "
"abiding loathing for legalese; they associate it with deception, "
":ref:`suit`\\s, and situations in which hackers generally get the short "
"end of the stick."
