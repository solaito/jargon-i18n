"Said of people, this indicates a poor memory, usually short-term. This "
"usage is analogical to the same term applied to data compression and "
"analysis. \"He's very lossy.\" means that you can't rely on him to "
"accurately remember recent experiences or conversations, or requests. Not"
" to be confused with a ‘loser’, which is a person who is in a continual "
"state of lossiness, as in sense 2 (see below)."

"Said of an attitude or a situation, this indicates a general downturn in "
"emotions, lack of success in attempted endeavors, etc. Eg, \"I'm having a"
" lossy day today.\" means that the speaker has ‘lost’ or is ‘losing’ in "
"all of their activities, and that this is causing some increase in "
"negative emotions."
