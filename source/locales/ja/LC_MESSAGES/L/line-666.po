"[from Christian eschatological myth] n. The notional line of source at "
"which a program fails for obscure reasons, implying either that "
"*somebody* is out to get it (when you are the programmer), or that it "
"richly deserves to be so gotten (when you are not). \"It works when I "
"trace through it, but seems to crash on line 666 when I run it.\" \"What "
"happens is that whenever a large batch comes through, mmdf dies on the "
"Line of the Beast. Probably some twit hardcoded a buffer size.\""
