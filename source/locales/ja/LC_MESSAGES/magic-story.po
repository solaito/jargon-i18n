"Some years ago, I (GLS) was snooping around in the cabinets that housed "
"the MIT AI Lab's PDP-10, and noticed a little switch glued to the frame "
"of one cabinet. It was obviously a homebrew job, added by one of the "
"lab's hardware hackers (no one knows who)."

"You don't touch an unknown switch on a computer without knowing what it "
"does, because you might crash the computer. The switch was labeled in a "
"most unhelpful way. It had two positions, and scrawled in pencil on the "
"metal switch body were the words ‘magic' and ‘more magic'. The switch was"
" in the ‘more magic' position."

"I called another hacker over to look at it. He had never seen the switch "
"before either. Closer examination revealed that the switch had only one "
"wire running to it! The other end of the wire did disappear into the maze"
" of wires inside the computer, but it's a basic fact of electricity that "
"a switch can't do anything unless there are two wires connected to it. "
"This switch had a wire connected on one side and no wire on its other "
"side."

"It was clear that this switch was someone's idea of a silly joke. "
"Convinced by our reasoning that the switch was inoperative, we flipped "
"it. The computer instantly crashed."

"Imagine our utter astonishment. We wrote it off as coincidence, but "
"nevertheless restored the switch to the ‘more magic’ position before "
"reviving the computer."

"A year later, I told this story to yet another hacker, David Moon as I "
"recall. He clearly doubted my sanity, or suspected me of a supernatural "
"belief in the power of this switch, or perhaps thought I was fooling him "
"with a bogus saga. To prove it to him, I showed him the very switch, "
"still glued to the cabinet frame with only one wire connected to it, "
"still in the ‘more magic’ position. We scrutinized the switch and its "
"lone connection, and found that the other end of the wire, though "
"connected to the computer wiring, was connected to a ground pin. That "
"clearly made the switch doubly useless: not only was it electrically "
"nonoperative, but it was connected to a place that couldn't affect "
"anything anyway. So we flipped the switch."

"This time we ran for Richard Greenblatt, a long-time MIT hacker, who was "
"close at hand. He had never noticed the switch before, either. He "
"inspected it, concluded it was useless, got some diagonal cutters and "
":ref:`dike`\\d it out. We then revived the computer and it has run fine "
"ever since."

"We still don't know how the switch crashed the machine. There is a theory"
" that some circuit near the ground pin was marginal, and flipping the "
"switch changed the electrical capacitance enough to upset the circuit as "
"millionth-of-a-second pulses went through it. But we'll never know for "
"sure; all we can really say is that the switch was :ref:`magic`\\."

"1994: Another explanation of this story has since been offered. Note that"
" the switch body was metal. Suppose that the non-connected side of the "
"switch was connected to the switch body (usually the body is connected to"
" a separate earth lug, but there are exceptions). The body is connected "
"to the computer case, which is, presumably, grounded. Now the circuit "
"ground within the machine isn't necessarily at the same potential as the "
"case ground, so flipping the switch connected the circuit ground to the "
"case ground, causing a voltage drop/jump which reset the machine. This "
"was probably discovered by someone who found out the hard way that there "
"was a potential difference between the two, and who then wired in the "
"switch as a joke."
