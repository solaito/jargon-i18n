"through means like letters to newspapers from soi-disant ‘concerned "
"citizens’, paid opinion pieces, and the formation of grass-roots lobbying"
" groups that are actually funded by a PR group (AstroTurf is fake grass; "
"hence the term). See also :ref:`sock-puppet`\\, :ref:`tentacle`\\."

"This term became common among hackers after it came to light in early "
"1998 that Microsoft had attempted to use such tactics to forestall the "
"U.S. Department of Justice's antitrust action against the company. The "
"maneuver backfired horribly, angering a number of state attorneys-general"
" enough to induce them to go public with plans to join the Federal suit. "
"It also set anybody defending Microsoft on the net for the accusation "
"\"You're just astroturfing! \"."
