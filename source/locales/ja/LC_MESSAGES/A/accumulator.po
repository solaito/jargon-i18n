"Archaic term for a register. On-line use of it as a synonym for register "
"is a fairly reliable indication that the user has been around for quite a"
" while and/or that the architecture under discussion is quite old. The "
"term in full is almost never used of microprocessor registers, for "
"example, though symbolic names for arithmetic registers beginning in ‘A’ "
"derive from historical use of the term accumulator (and not, actually, "
"from ‘arithmetic’). Confusingly, though, an ‘A’ register name prefix may "
"also stand for address, as for example on the Motorola 680x0 family."

"A register being used for arithmetic or logic (as opposed to addressing "
"or a loop index), especially one being used to accumulate a sum or count "
"of many items. This use is in context of a particular routine or stretch "
"of code. \"The FOOBAZ routine uses A3 as an accumulator.\""
