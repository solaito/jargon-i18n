"[MIT, Stanford: by analogy with NP-complete (see :ref:`NP-`\\)] Used to "
"describe problems or subproblems in AI, to indicate that the solution "
"presupposes a solution to the ‘strong AI problem’ (that is, the synthesis"
" of a human-level intelligence). A problem that is AI-complete is, in "
"other words, just too hard."

"Examples of AI-complete problems are ‘The Vision Problem’ (building a "
"system that can see as well as a human) and ‘The Natural Language "
"Problem’ (building a system that can understand and speak a natural "
"language as well as a human). These may appear to be modular, but all "
"attempts so far (2003) to solve them have foundered on the amount of "
"context information and ‘intelligence’ they seem to require. See also "
":ref:`gedanken`\\."
