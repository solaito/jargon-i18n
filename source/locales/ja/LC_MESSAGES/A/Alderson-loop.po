"[Intel] A special version of an :ref:`infinite-loop` where there is an "
"exit condition available, but inaccessible in the current implementation "
"of the code. Typically this is created while debugging user interface "
"code. An example would be when there is a menu stating, \"Select 1-3 or 9"
" to quit\" and 9 is not allowed by the function that takes the selection "
"from the user."

"This term received its name from a programmer who had coded a modal "
"message box in MSAccess with no Ok or Cancel buttons, thereby disabling "
"the entire program whenever the box came up. The message box had the "
"proper code for dismissal and even was set up so that when the non-"
"existent Ok button was pressed the proper code would be called."
