"[originally an acronym (American Standard Code for Information "
"Interchange) but now merely conventional] The predominant character set "
"encoding of present-day computers. The standard version uses 7 bits for "
"each character, whereas most earlier codes (including early drafts of "
"ASCII prior to June 1961) used fewer. This change allowed the inclusion "
"of lowercase letters — a major :ref:`win` — but it did not provide for "
"accented letters or any other letterforms not used in English (such as "
"the German sharp-S ß. or the ae-ligature æ which is a letter in, for "
"example, Norwegian). It could be worse, though. It could be much worse. "
"See :ref:`EBCDIC` to understand how. A history of ASCII and its ancestors"
" is at `http://www.wps.com/texts/codes/index.html "

"Computers are much pickier and less flexible about spelling than humans; "
"thus, hackers need to be very precise when talking about characters, and "
"have developed a considerable amount of verbal shorthand for them. Every "
"character has one or more names — some formal, some concise, some silly. "
"Common jargon names for ASCII characters are collected here. See also "
"individual entries for :ref:`bang`\\, :ref:`excl`\\, :ref:`open`\\, "
":ref:`ques`\\, :ref:`semi`\\, :ref:`shriek`\\, :ref:`splat`\\, "

"This list derives from revision 2.3 of the Usenet ASCII pronunciation "
"guide. Single characters are listed in ASCII order; character pairs are "
"sorted in by first member. For each character, common names are given in "
"rough order of popularity, followed by names that are reported but rarely"
" seen; official ANSI/CCITT names are surrounded by brokets: <>. Square "
"brackets mark the particularly silly names introduced by "
":ref:`INTERCAL`\\. The abbreviations \"l/r\" and \"o/c\" stand for "
"left/right and \"open/close\" respectively. Ordinary parentheticals "
"provide some usage information."

"The pronunciation of ``#`` as ‘pound’ is common in the U.S. but a bad "

"of ‘pound sign’ (confusingly, on British keyboards the £ happens to "
"replace ``#``\\; thus Britishers sometimes call ``#`` on a U.S.-ASCII "
"keyboard ‘pound’, compounding the American error). The U.S. usage derives"
" from an old-fashioned commercial practice of using a ``#`` suffix to tag"
" pound weights on bills of lading. The character is usually pronounced "
"‘hash’ outside the U.S. There are more culture wars over the correct "
"pronunciation of this character than any other, which has led to the :ref"

"The inability of ASCII text to correctly represent any of the world's "
"other major languages makes the designers' choice of 7 bits look more and"
" more like a serious :ref:`misfeature` as the use of international "
"networks continues to increase (see :ref:`software-rot`\\). Hardware and "
"software from the U.S. still tends to embody the assumption that ASCII is"
" the universal character set and that characters have 7 bits; this is a "
"major irritant to people who want to use a character set suited to their "
"own languages. Perversely, though, efforts to solve this problem by "
"proliferating ‘national’ character sets produce an evolutionary pressure "
"to use a *smaller* subset common to all those in use."
