"The prototypical computer adventure game, first designed by Will Crowther"
" on the :ref:`PDP-10` in the mid-1970s as an attempt at computer-refereed"
" fantasy gaming, and expanded into a puzzle-oriented game by Don Woods at"
" Stanford in 1976. (Woods had been one of the authors of "
":ref:`INTERCAL`\\.) Now better known as Adventure or Colossal Cave "
"Adventure, but the :ref:`TOPS-10` operating system permitted only six-"
"letter filenames in uppercase. See also :ref:`vadding`\\, :ref:`Zork`\\, "
"and :ref:`Infocom`\\."

"This game defined the terse, dryly humorous style since expected in text "
"adventure games, and popularized several tag lines that have become "
"fixtures of hacker-speak: \"A huge green fierce snake bars the way!\" \"I"
" see no X here\" (for some noun X). \"You are in a maze of twisty little "
"passages, all alike.\" \"You are in a little maze of twisty passages, all"
" different.\" The ‘magic words’ :ref:`xyzzy` and :ref:`plugh` also derive"
" from this game."

"Crowther, by the way, participated in the exploration of the Mammoth & "
"Flint Ridge cave system; it actually *has* a Colossal Cave and a Bedquilt"
" as in the game, and the Y2 that also turns up is cavers' jargon for a "
"map reference to a secondary entrance."
