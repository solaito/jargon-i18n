"Abnormal termination (of software); :ref:`crash`\\; :ref:`lossage`\\. "
"Derives from an error message on the IBM 360; used jokingly by hackers "
"but seriously mainly by :ref:`code-grinder`\\s. Usually capitalized, but "
"may appear as ‘abend’. Hackers will try to persuade you that ABEND is "
"called abend because it is what system operators do to the machine late "
"on Friday when they want to call it a day, and hence is from the German "
"*Abend* = ‘Evening’."

"[ :samp:`alt.callahans`\\] Absent By Enforced Net Deprivation — used in "
"the subject lines of postings warning friends of an imminent loss of "
"Internet access. (This can be because of computer downtime, loss of "
"provider, moving or illness.) Variants of this also appear: ABVND = "
"‘Absent By Voluntary Net Deprivation’ and ABSEND = ‘Absent By Self-"
"Enforced Net Deprivation’ have been sighted."
