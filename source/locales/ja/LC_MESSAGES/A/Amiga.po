"A series of personal computer models originally sold by Commodore, based "
"on 680x0 processors, custom support chips and an operating system that "
"combined some of the best features of Macintosh and Unix with "
"compatibility with neither."

"The Amiga was released just as the personal computing world standardized "
"on IBM-PC clones. This prevented it from gaining serious market share, "
"despite the fact that the first Amigas had a substantial technological "
"lead on the IBM XTs of the time. Instead, it acquired a small but zealous"
" population of enthusiastic hackers who dreamt of one day unseating the "
"clones (see :ref:`Amiga-Persecution-Complex`\\). The traits of this "
"culture are both spoofed and illuminated in `The BLAZE Humor Viewer "
"<http://www.blazemonger.com/BM/>`_. The strength of the Amiga platform "
"seeded a small industry of companies building software and hardware for "
"the platform, especially in graphics and video applications (see :ref"
":`video-toaster`\\)."

"Due to spectacular mismanagement, Commodore did hardly any R&D, allowing "
"the competition to close Amiga's technological lead. After Commodore went"
" bankrupt in 1994 the technology passed through several hands, none of "
"whom did much with it. However, the Amiga is still being produced in "
"Europe under license and has a substantial number of fans, which will "
"probably extend the platform's life considerably."
