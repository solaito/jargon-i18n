"[acronym, ‘Automated Retroactive Minimal Moderation’] A Usenet "
":ref:`cancelbot` created by Dick Depew of Munroe Falls, Ohio. ARMM was "
"intended to automatically cancel posts from anonymous-posting sites. "
"Unfortunately, the robot's recognizer for anonymous postings triggered on"
" its own automatically-generated control messages! Transformed by this "
"stroke of programming ineptitude into a monster of Frankensteinian "
"proportions, it broke loose on the night of March 30, 1993 and proceeded "
"to :ref:`spam` :samp:`news.admin.policy` with a recursive explosion of "
"over 200 messages."

"ARMM's bug produced a recursive :ref:`cascade` of messages each of which "
"mechanically added text to the ID and Subject and some other headers of "
"its parent. This produced a flood of messages in which each header took "
"up several screens and each message ID and subject line got longer and "
"longer and longer."

"Reactions varied from amusement to outrage. The pathological messages "
"crashed at least one mail system, and upset people paying line charges "
"for their Usenet feeds. One poster described the ARMM debacle as "
"\"instant Usenet history\" (also establishing the term :ref:`despew`\\), "
"and it has since been widely cited as a cautionary example of the havoc "
"the combination of good intentions and incompetence can wreak on a "
"network. The Usenet thread on the subject is `archived here "
"<http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=tweekC4qM0A.H3q%40netcom.com>`_."
" Compare :ref:`Great-Worm`\\; :ref:`sorcerers-apprentice-mode`\\. See "
