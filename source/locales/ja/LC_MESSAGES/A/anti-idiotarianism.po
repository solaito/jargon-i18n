"[very common] Opposition to idiots of all political stripes. First coined"
" in the :ref:`blog` named `Little Green Footballs "
"<http://www.littlegreenfootballs.com/weblog/weblog.php>`_\\  as part of a"
" post expressing disgust with inane responses to post-9/11 Islamic "
"terrorism. Anti-idiotarian wrath has focused on Islamic terrorists and "
"their sympathizers in the Western political left, but also routinely "
"excoriated right-wing politicians backing repressive ’anti-terror‘ "
"legislation and Christian religious figures who (in the blogosphere's "
"view of the matter) have descended nearly to the level of jihad "
"themselves."
