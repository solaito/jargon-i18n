"Like :ref:`nethack`\\, :ref:`moria`\\, and :ref:`rogue`\\, one of the "
"large freely distributed Dungeons-and-Dragons-like simulation games, "
"available for a wide range of machines and operating systems. The name is"
" from Tolkien's Pits of Angband (compare :ref:`elder-days`\\, "
":ref:`elvish`\\). Has been described as \"Moria on steroids\"; but, "
"unlike Moria, many aspects of the game are customizable. This leads many "
"hackers and would-be hackers into fooling with these instead of doing "
"productive work. There are many Angband variants, of which the most "
"notorious is probably the rather whimsical Zangband. In this game, when a"
" key that does not correspond to a command is pressed, the game will "
"display \"Type ? for help\" 50% of the time. The other 50% of the time, "
"random error messages including \"An error has occurred because an error "
"of type 42 has occurred\" and \"Windows 95 uninstalled successfully\" "
"will be displayed. Zangband also allows the player to kill Santa Claus "
"(who has some really good stuff, but also has a lot of friends), \"Bull "
"Gates\", and Barney the Dinosaur (but be watchful; Barney has a nasty "
"case of halitosis). There is an official angband home page at "
"`http://thangorodrim.angband.org/ <http://thangorodrim.angband.org/>`_\\"
"  and a zangband one at `http://www.zangband.org/ "
"<http://www.zangband.org/>`_. See also :ref:`Random-Number-God`\\."
