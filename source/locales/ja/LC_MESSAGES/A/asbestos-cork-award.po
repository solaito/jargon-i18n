"Once, long ago at MIT, there was a :ref:`flamer` so consistently "
"obnoxious that another hacker designed, had made, and distributed posters"
" announcing that said flamer had been nominated for the asbestos cork "
"award. (Any reader in doubt as to the intended application of the cork "
"should consult the etymology under :ref:`flame`\\.) Since then, it is "
"agreed that only a select few have risen to the heights of bombast "
"required to earn this dubious dignity â€” but there is no agreement on "
"*which* few."
