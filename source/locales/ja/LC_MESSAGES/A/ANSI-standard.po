"typical or broadly done. It's most appropriately applied to things that "
"everyone does that are not quite regulation. For example: ANSI standard "
"shaking of a laser printer cartridge to get extra life from it, or the "
"ANSI standard word tripling in names of usenet alt groups."

"This usage derives from the American National Standards Institute. ANSI, "
"along with the International Organization for Standards (ISO), "
"standardized the C programming language (see :ref:`K-ampersand-R`\\, "
":ref:`Classic-C`\\), and promulgates many other important software "
"standards."
