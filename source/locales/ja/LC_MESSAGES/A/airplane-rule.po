"\"Complexity increases the possibility of failure; a twin-engine airplane"
" has twice as many engine problems as a single-engine airplane.\" By "
"analogy, in both software and electronics, the rule that simplicity "
"increases robustness. It is correspondingly argued that the right way to "
"build reliable systems is to put all your eggs in one basket, after "
"making sure that you've built a really *good* basket. See also :ref"
