"Short for ‘application program’, as opposed to a systems program. Apps "
"are what systems vendors are forever chasing developers to create for "
"their environments so they can sell more boxes. Hackers tend not to think"
" of the things they themselves run as apps; thus, in hacker parlance the "
"term excludes compilers, program editors, games, and messaging systems, "
"though a user would consider all those to be apps. (Broadly, an app is "
"often a self-contained environment for performing some well-defined task "
"such as ‘word processing’; hackers tend to prefer more general-purpose "
"tools.) See :ref:`killer-app`\\; oppose :ref:`tool`\\, :ref:`operating-"
"system`\\."
