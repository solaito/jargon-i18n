"Indivisible; cannot be split up. For example, an instruction may be said "
"to do several things ‘atomically’, i.e., all the things are done "
"immediately, and there is no chance of the instruction being half-"
"completed or of another being interspersed. Used esp. to convey that an "
"operation cannot be screwed up by interrupts. \"This routine locks the "
"file and increments the file's semaphore atomically.\""

"[primarily techspeak] Guaranteed to complete successfully or not at all, "
"usu. refers to database transactions. If an error prevents a partially-"
"performed transaction from proceeding to completion, it must be \"backed "
"out\", as the database must not be left in an inconsistent state."

"Computer usage, in either of the above senses, has none of the "
"connotations that ‘atomic’ has in mainstream English (i.e. of particles "
"of matter, nuclear explosions etc. )."
