"A bad visual-interface design that uses too many colors. (This term "
"derives, of course, from the bizarre day-glo colors found in canned fruit"
" salad.) Too often one sees similar effects from interface designers "
"using color window systems such as :ref:`X`\\; there is a tendency to "
"create displays that are flashy and attention-getting but uncomfortable "
"for long-term use."
