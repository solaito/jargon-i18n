"The archetypal individuals used as examples in discussions of "
"cryptographic protocols. Originally, theorists would say something like: "
"\"A communicates with someone who claims to be B, So to be sure, A tests "
"that B knows a secret number K. So A sends to B a random number X. B then"
" forms Y by encrypting X under key K and sends Y back to A\" Because this"
" sort of thing is quite hard to follow, theorists stopped using the "
"unadorned letters A and B to represent the main players and started "
"calling them Alice and Bob. So now we say \"Alice communicates with "
"someone claiming to be Bob, and to be sure, Alice tests that Bob knows a "
"secret number K. Alice sends to Bob a random number X. Bob then forms Y "
"by encrypting X under key K and sends Y back to Alice\". A whole "
"mythology rapidly grew up around the metasyntactic names; see "

"In Bruce Schneier's definitive introductory text *Applied Cryptography* "
"(2nd ed., 1996, John Wiley & Sons, ISBN 0-471-11709-9) he introduced a "
"table of dramatis personae headed by Alice and Bob. Others include Carol "
"(a participant in three- and four-party protocols), Dave (a participant "
"in four-party protocols), Eve (an eavesdropper), Mallory (a malicious "
"active attacker), Trent (a trusted arbitrator), Walter (a warden), Peggy "
"(a prover) and Victor (a verifier). These names for roles are either "
"already standard or, given the wide popularity of the book, may be "
"expected to quickly become so."
