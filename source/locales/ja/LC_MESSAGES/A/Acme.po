"[from Greek *akme* highest point of perfection or achievement] The "
"canonical supplier of bizarre, elaborate, and non-functional gadgetry — "
"where Rube Goldberg and Heath Robinson (two cartoonists who specialized "
"in elaborate contraptions) shop. The name has been humorously expanded as"
" A (or American) Company Making Everything. (In fact, Acme was a real "
"brand sold from Sears Roebuck catalogs in the early 1900s.) Describing "
"some X as an \"Acme X\" either means \"This is :ref:`insanely-great`\\\","
" or, more likely, \"This looks :ref:`insanely-great` on paper, but in "
"practice it's really easy to shoot yourself in the foot with it.\" "
"Compare :ref:`pistol`\\."

"This term, specially cherished by American hackers and explained here for"
" the benefit of our overseas brethren, comes from the Warner Brothers' "
"series of \"Road-runner\" cartoons. In these cartoons, the famished Wile "
"E. Coyote was forever attempting to catch up with, trap, and eat the "
"Road-runner. His attempts usually involved one or more high-technology "
"Rube Goldberg devices — rocket jetpacks, catapults, magnetic traps, high-"
"powered slingshots, etc. These were usually delivered in large wooden "
"crates labeled prominently with the Acme name — which, probably not by "
"coincidence, was the trade name of a peg bar system for superimposing "
"animation cels used by cartoonists since forever. Acme devices invariably"
" malfunctioned in improbable and violent ways."
