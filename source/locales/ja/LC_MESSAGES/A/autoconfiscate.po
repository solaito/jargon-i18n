"To set up or modify a source-code :ref:`distribution` so that it "
"configures and builds using the GNU project's autoconf/automake/libtools "
"suite. Among open-source hackers, a mere running binary of a program is "
"not considered a full release; what's interesting is a source tree that "
"can be built into binaries using standard tools. Since the mid-1990s, "
"autoconf and friends been the standard way to adapt a distribution for "
"portability so that it can be built on multiple operating systems without"
" change."
