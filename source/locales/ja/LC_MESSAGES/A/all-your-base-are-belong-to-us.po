"A declaration of victory or superiority. The phrase stems from a 1991 "
"adaptation of Toaplan's \"Zero Wing\" shoot-'em-up arcade game for the "
"Sega Genesis game console. A brief introduction was added to the opening "
"screen, and it has what many consider to be the worst Japanese-to-English"
" translation in video game history. The introduction shows the bridge of "
"a starship in chaos as a Borg-like figure named CATS materializes and "
"says, \"How are you gentlemen!! All your base are belong to us.\" [sic] "
"In 2001, this amusing mistranslation spread virally through the Internet,"
" bringing with it a slew of JPEGs and a movie of hacked photographs, each"
" showing a street sign, store front, package label, etc. hacked to read "
"\"All your base are belong to us\" or one of the other many supremely "
"dopey lines from the game (such as \"Somebody set up usthe bomb!!!\" or "
"\"What happen?\"). When these phrases are used properly, the overall "
"effect is both screamingly funny and somewhat chilling, reminiscent of "
"the B movie \"They Live\"."

"The original has been generalized to \"All your X are belong to us\", "
"where X is filled in to connote a sinister takeover of some sort. Thus, "
"\"When Joe signed up for his new job at Yoyodyne, he had to sign a "
"draconian NDA. It basically said: All your code are belong to us.\" Has "
"many of the connotations of \"Resistance is futile; you will be "
"assimilated\" (see :ref:`Borg`\\). Considered silly, and most likely to "
"be used by the type of person that finds :ref:`Jeff-K-` hilarious."
