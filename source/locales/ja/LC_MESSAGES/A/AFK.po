"[MUD] Abbrev. for \"Away From Keyboard\". Used to notify others that you "
"will be momentarily unavailable online. eg. \"Let's not go kill that "
"frost giant yet, I need to go AFK to make a phone call\". Often MUDs will"
" have a command to politely inform others of your absence when they try "
"to talk with you. The term is not restricted to MUDs, however, and has "
"become common in many chat situations, from IRC to Unix talk."
