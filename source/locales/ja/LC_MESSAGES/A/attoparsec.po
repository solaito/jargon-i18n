"About an inch.*atto-* is the standard SI prefix for multiplication by "
":math:`10^{-18}`\\. A parsec (parallax-second) is 3.26 light-years; an "
"attoparsec is thus :math:`3.26 Ã— 10^{-18}` light years, or about 3.1 cm "
"(thus, 1 attoparsec/ :ref:`microfortnight` equals about 1 inch/sec). This"
" unit is reported to be in use (though probably not very seriously) among"
" hackers in the U.K. See :ref:`micro-`\\."
