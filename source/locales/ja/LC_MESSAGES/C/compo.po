"[ :ref:`demoscene`\\] Finnish-originated slang for ‘competition’. Demo "
"compos are held at a :ref:`demoparty`\\. The usual protocol is that "
"several groups make demos for a compo, they are shown on a big screen, "
"and then the party participants vote for the best one. Prizes (from "
"sponsors and party entrance fees) are given. Standard compo formats "
"include :ref:`intro` compos (4k or 64k demos), music compos, graphics "
"compos, quick :ref:`demo` compos (build a demo within 4 hours for "
"example), etc."
