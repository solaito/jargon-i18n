"Main storage or RAM. Dates from the days of ferrite-core memory; now "
"archaic as techspeak most places outside IBM, but also still used in the "
"Unix community and by old-time hackers or those who would sound like "
"them. Some derived idioms are quite current; in core, for example, means "
"‘in memory’ (as opposed to ‘on disk’), and both :ref:`core-dump` and the "
"core image or core file produced by one are terms in favor. Some "
"varieties of Commonwealth hackish prefer :ref:`store`\\."
