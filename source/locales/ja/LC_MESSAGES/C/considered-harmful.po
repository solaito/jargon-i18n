"[very common] Edsger W. Dijkstra's note in the March 1968 *Communications"
" of the ACM*\\, *Goto Statement Considered Harmful*\\, fired the first "
"salvo in the structured programming wars (text at "
"`http://www.acm.org/classics/ <http://www.acm.org/classics/>`_). As it "
"`turns out <http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/26585.html>`_, the "
"title under which the letter appeared was actually supplied by CACM's "
"editor, Niklaus Wirth. Amusingly, the ACM considered the resulting "
"acrimony sufficiently harmful that it will (by policy) no longer print an"
" article taking so assertive a position against a coding practice. (Years"
" afterwards, a contrary view was uttered in a CACM letter called, "
"inevitably, *‘Goto considered harmful’ considered harmful'*\\'. In the "
"ensuing decades, a large number of both serious papers and parodies have "
"borne titles of the form *X considered Y*\\. The structured-programming "
"wars eventually blew over with the realization that both sides were "
"wrong, but use of such titles has remained as a persistent minor in-joke "
"(the ‘considered silly’ found at various places in this lexicon is "
"related)."
