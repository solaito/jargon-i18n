"In physics, the minimum amount of fissionable material required to "
"sustain a chain reaction. Of a software product, describes a condition of"
" the software such that fixing one bug introduces one plus :ref:`epsilon`"
" bugs. (This malady has many causes: :ref:`creeping-featurism`\\, ports "
"to too many disparate environments, poor initial design, etc.) When "
"software achieves critical mass, it can never be fixed; it can only be "
"discarded and rewritten."
