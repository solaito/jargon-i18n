"[Usenet] The archetype and model of all good :ref:`spam`\\-fighters. Once"
" upon a time, the 'Moose would send out spam-cancels and then post notice"
" anonymously to :samp:`news.admin.policy`\\, :samp:`news.admin.misc`\\, "
"and :samp:`alt.current-events.net-abuse`\\. The 'Moose stepped to the "
"fore on its own initiative, at a time (mid-1994) when spam-cancels were "
"irregular and disorganized, and behaved altogether admirably — fair, "
"even-handed, and quick to respond to comments and criticism, all without "
"self-aggrandizement or martyrdom. Cancelmoose[tm] quickly gained near-"
"unanimous support from the readership of all three above-mentioned "
"groups."

"Nobody knows who Cancelmoose[tm] really is, and there aren't even any "
"good rumors. However, the 'Moose now has an e-mail address "
"(<moose@cm.org>) and a web site (`http://www.cm.org/ "
"<http://www.cm.org/>`_.) By early 1995, others had stepped into the spam-"
"cancel business, and appeared to be comporting themselves well, after the"
" 'Moose's manner. The 'Moose has now gotten out of the business, and is "
"more interested in ending spam (and cancels) entirely."
