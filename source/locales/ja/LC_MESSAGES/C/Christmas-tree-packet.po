"A packet with every single option set for whatever protocol is in use. "
"See :ref:`kamikaze-packet`\\, :ref:`Chernobyl-packet`\\. (The term "
"doubtless derives from a fanciful image of each little option bit being "
"represented by a different-colored light bulb, all turned on.) Compare "
":ref:`Godzillagram`\\."
