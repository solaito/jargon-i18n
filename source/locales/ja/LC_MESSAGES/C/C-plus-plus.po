"Designed by Bjarne Stroustrup of AT&T Bell Labs as a successor to "
":ref:`C`\\. Now one of the :ref:`languages-of-choice`\\, although many "
"hackers still grumble that it is the successor to either Algol 68 or Ada "
"(depending on generation), and a prime example of :ref:`second-system-"
"effect`\\. Almost anything that can be done in any language can be done "
"in C++, but it requires a :ref:`language-lawyer` to know what is and what"
" is not legal — the design is *almost* too large to hold in even hackers'"
" heads. Much of the :ref:`cruft` results from C++'s attempt to be "
"backward compatible with C. Stroustrup himself has said in his "
"retrospective book *The Design and Evolution of C++* (p. 207), \"Within "
"C++, there is a much smaller and cleaner language struggling to get "
"out.\" [Many hackers would now add \"Yes, and it's called :ref:`Java`\\\""
