"[Commodore] The Commodore Business Machines logo, which strongly "
"resembles a poultry part (within Commodore itself the logo was always "
"called chicken lips). Rendered in ASCII as ‘C=’. With the arguable "
"exception of the :ref:`Amiga`\\, Commodore's machines were notoriously "
"crocky little :ref:`bitty-box`\\es, albeit people have written "
"multitasking Unix-like operating systems with TCP/IP networking for them."
" Thus, this usage may owe something to Philip K. Dick's novel *Do "
"Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?* (the basis for the movie *Blade "
"Runner*\\; the novel is now sold under that title), in which a "
"‘chickenhead’ is a mutant with below-average intelligence."
