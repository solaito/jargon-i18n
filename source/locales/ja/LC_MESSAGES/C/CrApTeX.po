"[University of York, England] Term of abuse used to describe TeX and "
"LaTeX when they don't work (when used by TeXhackers), or all the time (by"
" everyone else). The non-TeX-enthusiasts generally dislike it because it "
"is more verbose than other formatters (e.g. :ref:`troff`\\) and because "
"(particularly if the standard Computer Modern fonts are used) it "
"generates vast output files. See :ref:`religious-issues`\\, :ref:`TeX`\\."
