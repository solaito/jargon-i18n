"A syndrome of certain Iomega ZIP drives, named for the clicking noise "
"that is caused by the malady. An affected drive will, after accepting a "
"disk, start making a clicking noise and refuse to eject the disk. A "
"common solution for retrieving the disk is to insert the bent end of a "
"paper clip into a small hole adjacent to the slot. \"Clicked\" disks are "
"generally unusable after being retrieved from the drive."

"The clicking noise is caused by the drive's read/write head bumping "
"against its movement stops when it fails to find track 0 on the disk, "
"causing the head to become misaligned. This can happen when the drive has"
" been subjected to a physical shock, or when the disk is exposed to an "
"electromagnetic field, such as that of the CRT. Another common cause is "
"when a package of disks is armed with an anti-theft strip at a store. "
"When the clerk scans the product to disarm the strip, it can demagnetize "
"the disks, wiping out track 0."

"There is evidence that the click of death is a communicable disease; a "
"\"clicked\" disk can cause the read/write head of a \"clean\" drive to "
"become misaligned. Iomega at first denied the existence of the click of "
"death, but eventually offered to replace free of charge any drives "
"affected by the condition."
