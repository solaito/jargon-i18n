"\"Received\" headers that show how mail flows through systems, then MIME "
"(Multi-purpose Internet Mail Extensions) headers and part boundaries, and"

"authenticity. This stuff all serves a purpose and good user interfaces "
"should hide it, but all too often users are forced to wade through it."
