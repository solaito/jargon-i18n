"[COmmon Business-Oriented Language] (Synonymous with :ref:`evil`\\.) A "
"weak, verbose, and flabby language used by :ref:`code-grinder`\\s to do "
"boring mindless things on :ref:`dinosaur` mainframes. Hackers believe "
"that all COBOL programmers are :ref:`suit`\\s or :ref:`code-grinder`\\s, "
"and no self-respecting hacker will ever admit to having learned the "
"language. Its very name is seldom uttered without ritual expressions of "
"disgust or horror. One popular one is Edsger W. Dijkstra's famous "
"observation that \"The use of COBOL cripples the mind; its teaching "
"should, therefore, be regarded as a criminal offense.\" (from *Selected "
"Writings on Computing: A Personal Perspective*\\) See also :ref:`fear-"
"and-loathing`\\, :ref:`software-rot`\\."
