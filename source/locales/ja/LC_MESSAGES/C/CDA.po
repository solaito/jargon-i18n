"The \"Communications Decency Act\", passed as section 502 of a major "
"telecommunications reform bill on February 8th, 1996 (\"Black "
"Thursday\"). The CDA made it a federal crime in the USA to send a "
"communication which is \"obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent, "
"with intent to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass another person.\" It "
"also threatened with imprisonment anyone who \"knowingly\" makes "
"accessible to minors any message that \"describes, in terms patently "
"offensive as measured by contemporary community standards, sexual or "
"excretory activities or organs\"."

"While the CDA was sold as a measure to protect minors from the putative "
"evils of pornography, the repressive political aims of the bill were laid"
" bare by the Hyde amendment, which intended to outlaw discussion of "
"abortion on the Internet."

"To say that this direct attack on First Amendment free-speech rights was "
"not well received on the Internet would be putting it mildly. A firestorm"
" of protest followed, including a February 29th 1996 mass demonstration "
"by thousands of netters who turned their :ref:`home-page`\\s black for 48"
" hours. Several civil-rights groups and computing/telecommunications "
"companies mounted a constitutional challenge. The CDA was demolished by a"
" strongly-worded decision handed down in 8th-circuit Federal court and "
"subsequently affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court on 26 June 1997 (\"White "
"Thursday\"). See also :ref:`Exon`\\."
