"[from LISP] To skip past the first item from a list of things "
"(generalized from the LISP operation on binary tree structures, which "
"returns a list consisting of all but the first element of its argument). "
"In the form cdr down, to trace down a list of elements: \"Shall we cdr "
"down the agenda?\" Usage: silly. See also :ref:`loop-through`\\."

"Historical note: The instruction format of the IBM 704 that hosted the "
"original LISP implementation featured two 15-bit fields called the "
"address and decrement parts. The term cdr was originally Contents of "
"Decrement part of Register. Similarly, car stood for Contents of Address "
"part of Register."

"The cdr and car operations have since become bases for formation of "
"compound metaphors in non-LISP contexts. GLS recalls, for example, a "
"programming project in which strings were represented as linked lists; "
"the get-character and skip-character operations were of course called "
"CHAR and CHDR."
