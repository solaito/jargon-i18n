"A hand gesture commonly accompanies this. To perform it, hold the four "
"fingers together and place the thumb against their tips. Now open and "
"close your hand rapidly to suggest a biting action (much like what Pac-"
"Man does in the classic video game, though this pantomime seems to "
"predate that). The gesture alone means ‘chomp chomp’ (see :ref:`Verb "
"Doubling<verb-doubling>` in the :ref:`Jargon Construction<construction>` "
"section of the Prependices). The hand may be pointed at the object of "
"complaint, and for real emphasis you can use both hands at once. Doing "
"this to a person is equivalent to saying \"You chomper!\" If you point "
"the gesture at yourself, it is a humble but humorous admission of some "
"failure. You might do this if someone told you that a program you had "
"written had failed in some surprising way and you felt dumb for not "
"having anticipated it."
