"Original term, pre-Sesame-Street, for what is now universally called a "
":ref:`cookie-monster`\\. A correspondent observes \"In those days, "
"hackers were actually getting their yucks from...sit down now...Andy "
"Williams. Yes, that Andy Williams. Seems he had a rather hip (by the "
"standards of the day) TV variety show. One of the best parts of the show "
"was the recurring ‘cookie bear’ sketch. In these sketches, a guy in a "
"bear suit tried all sorts of tricks to get a cookie out of Williams. The "
"sketches would always end with Williams shrieking (and I don't mean "
"figuratively), ‘No cookies! Not now, not ever...NEVER!! !’ And the bear "
"would fall down. Great stuff.\""
