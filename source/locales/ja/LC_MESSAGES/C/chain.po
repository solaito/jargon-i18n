"vi\\. [orig. from BASIC's :code:`CHAIN` statement] To hand off execution "
"to a child or successor without going through the :ref:`OS` command "
"interpreter that invoked it. The state of the parent program is lost and "
"there is no returning to it. Though this facility used to be common on "
"memory-limited micros and is still widely supported for backward "
"compatibility, the jargon usage is semi-obsolescent; in particular, most "
"Unix programmers will think of this as an :ref:`exec`\\. Oppose the more "
"modern subshell."

"n\\. A series of linked data areas within an operating system or "
"application. Chain rattling is the process of repeatedly running through "
"the linked data areas searching for one which is of interest to the "
"executing program. The implication is that there is a very large number "
"of links on the chain."
