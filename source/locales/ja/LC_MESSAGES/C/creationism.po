"The (false) belief that large, innovative software designs can be "
"completely specified in advance and then painlessly magicked out of the "
"void by the normal efforts of a team of normally talented programmers. In"
" fact, experience has shown repeatedly that good designs arise only from "
"evolutionary, exploratory interaction between one (or at most a small "
"handful of) exceptionally able designer(s) and an active user population "
"â€” and that the first try at a big new idea is always wrong. "
"Unfortunately, because these truths don't fit the planning models beloved"
" of :ref:`management`\\, they are generally ignored."
