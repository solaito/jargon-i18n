"[Unix] When used without a qualifier, generally refers to "
":ref:`crunch`\\ing of a file using a particular C implementation of "
"compression by Joseph M. Orost et al. : and widely circulated via "
":ref:`Usenet`\\; use of :ref:`crunch` itself in this sense is rare among "
"Unix hackers. Specifically, compress is built around the Lempel-Ziv-Welch"
" algorithm as described in \"A Technique for High Performance Data "
"Compression\", Terry A. Welch, *IEEE Computer*\\, vol. 17, no. 6 (June "
"1984), pp. 8--19."
