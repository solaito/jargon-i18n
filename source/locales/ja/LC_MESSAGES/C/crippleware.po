"An excellent example of crippleware (sense 3) is Intel's 486SX chip, "
"which is a standard 486DX chip with the co-processor diked out (in some "
"early versions it was present but disabled). To upgrade, you buy a "
"complete 486DX chip with *working* co-processor (its identity thinly "
"veiled by a different pinout) and plug it into the board's expansion "
"socket. It then disables the SX, which becomes a fancy power sink. Don't "
"you love Intel?"
