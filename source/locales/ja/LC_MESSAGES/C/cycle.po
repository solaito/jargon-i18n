"n\\. The basic unit of computation. What every hacker wants more of "
"(noted hacker Bill Gosper described himself as a \"cycle junkie\"). One "
"can describe an instruction as taking so many clock cycles. Often the "
"computer can access its memory once on every clock cycle, and so one "
"speaks also of memory cycles. These are technical meanings of "
":ref:`cycle`\\. The jargon meaning comes from the observation that there "
"are only so many cycles per second, and when you are sharing a computer "
"the cycles get divided up among the users. The more cycles the computer "
"spends working on your program rather than someone else's, the faster "
"your program will run. That's why every hacker wants more cycles: so he "
"can spend less time waiting for the computer to respond."

"to get involved with the Rubik's Cube back when it was big. Knew I'd burn"
" too many cycles on it if I let myself.\""
