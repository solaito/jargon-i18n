"[Usenet: portmanteau, clue + two-by-four] The notional stick with which "
"one whacks an aggressively clueless person. This term derives from a "
"western American folk saying about training a mule \"First, you got to "
"hit him with a two-by-four. That's to get his attention.\" The clue-by-"
"four is a close relative of the :ref:`LART`\\. Syn. clue stick. This "
"metaphor is commonly elaborated; your editor once heard a hacker say \"I "
"smite you with the great sword Cluebringer!\""
