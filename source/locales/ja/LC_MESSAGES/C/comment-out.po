"To surround a section of code with comment delimiters or to prefix every "
"line in the section with a comment marker; this prevents it from being "
"compiled or interpreted. Often done when the code is redundant or "
"obsolete, but is being left in the source to make the intent of the "
"active code clearer; also when the code in that section is broken and you"
" want to bypass it in order to debug some other part of the code. Compare"
" :ref:`condition-out`\\, usually the preferred technique in languages "
"(such as :ref:`C`\\) that make it possible."
