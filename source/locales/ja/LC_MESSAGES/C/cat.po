"Among Unix fans, :manpage:`cat(1)` is considered an excellent example of "
"user-interface design, because it delivers the file contents without such"

"not require the files to consist of lines of text, but works with any "
"sort of data."

"Among Unix haters, :manpage:`cat(1)` is considered the :ref:`canonical` "
"example of *bad* user-interface design, because of its woefully unobvious"
" name. It is far more often used to :ref:`blast` a file to standard "
"output than to concatenate two files. The name :code:`cat` for the former"
" operation is just as unintuitive as, say, LISP's :ref:`cdr`\\."
