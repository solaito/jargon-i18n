"Variant of :ref:`creeping-featurism`\\, with its own spoonerization: "
"feeping creaturitis. Some people like to reserve this form for the "
"disease as it actually manifests in software or hardware, as opposed to "
"the lurking general tendency in designers' minds. (After all, -ism means "
"‘condition’ or ‘pursuit of’, whereas -itis usually means ‘inflammation "
"of’.)"
