"n\\. A sudden, usually drastic failure. Most often said of the "
":ref:`system` (q.v., sense 1), esp. of magnetic disk drives (the term "
"originally described what happens when the air gap of a hard disk "
"collapses). \"Three :ref:`luser`\\s lost their files in last night's disk"
" crash.\" A disk crash that involves the read/write heads dropping onto "
"the surface of the disks and scraping off the oxide may also be referred "
"to as a head crash, whereas the term system crash usually, though not "
"always, implies that the operating system or other software was at fault."
