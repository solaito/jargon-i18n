"Of a design, describes the valuable property that it can all be "
"apprehended at once in one's head. This generally means the thing created"
" from the design can be used with greater facility and fewer errors than "
"an equivalent tool that is not compact. Compactness does not imply "
"triviality or lack of power; for example, C is compact and FORTRAN is "
"not, but C is more powerful than FORTRAN. Designs become non-compact "
"through accreting :ref:`feature`\\s and :ref:`cruft` that don't merge "
"cleanly into the overall design scheme (thus, some fans of "
":ref:`Classic-C` maintain that ANSI C is no longer compact)."
