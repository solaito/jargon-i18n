"A :ref:`suit`\\-wearing minion of the sort hired in legion strength by "
"banks and insurance companies to implement payroll packages in RPG and "
"other such unspeakable horrors. In its native habitat, the code grinder "
"often removes the suit jacket to reveal an underplumage consisting of "
"button-down shirt (starch optional) and a tie. In times of dire stress, "
"the sleeves (if long) may be rolled up and the tie loosened about half an"
" inch. It seldom helps. The :ref:`code-grinder`\\'s milieu is about as "
"far from hackerdom as one can get and still touch a computer; the term "
"connotes pity. See :ref:`Real-World`\\, :ref:`suit`\\."
