"Notional ‘information-space’ loaded with visual cues and navigable with "
"brain-computer interfaces called cyberspace decks; a characteristic prop "
"of :ref:`cyberpunk` SF. Serious efforts to construct :ref:`virtual-"
"reality` interfaces modeled explicitly on Gibsonian cyberspace are under "
"way, using more conventional devices such as glove sensors and binocular "
"TV headsets. Few hackers are prepared to deny outright the possibility of"
" a cyberspace someday evolving out of the network (see :ref:`the-"
"network`\\)."

"The Internet or :ref:`Matrix` (sense #2) as a whole, considered as a "
"crude cyberspace (sense 1). Although this usage became widely popular in "
"the mainstream press during 1994 when the Internet exploded into public "
"awareness, it is strongly deprecated among hackers because the Internet "
"does not meet the high, SF-inspired standards they have for true "
"cyberspace technology. Thus, this use of the term usually tags a "
":ref:`wannabee` or outsider. Oppose :ref:`meatspace`\\."

"Occasionally, the metaphoric location of the mind of a person in :ref"
":`hack-mode`\\. Some hackers report experiencing strong synesthetic "
"imagery when in hack mode; interestingly, independent reports from "
"multiple sources suggest that there are common features to the "
"experience. In particular, the dominant colors of this subjective "
"cyberspace are often gray and silver, and the imagery often involves "
"constellations of marching dots, elaborate shifting patterns of lines and"
" angles, or moire patterns."
