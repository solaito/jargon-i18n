"[very common; historically, ‘according to religious law’] The usual or "
"standard state or manner of something. This word has a somewhat more "
"technical meaning in mathematics. Two formulas such as ``9 + x`` and ``x "
"+ 9`` are said to be equivalent because they mean the same thing, but the"
" second one is in canonical form because it is written in the usual way, "
"with the highest power of ``x`` first. Usually there are fixed rules you "
"can use to decide whether something is in canonical form. The jargon "
"meaning, a relaxation of the technical meaning, acquired its present "
"loading in computer-science culture largely through its prominence in "
"Alonzo Church's work in computation theory and mathematical logic (see "
":ref:`Knights-of-the-Lambda-Calculus`\\). Compare :ref:`vanilla`\\."

"Non-technical academics do not use the adjective ‘canonical’ in any of "
"the senses defined above with any regularity; they do however use the "
"nouns canon and canonicity (not \\*\\*canonicalness or "
"\\*\\*canonicality). The canon of a given author is the complete body of "
"authentic works by that author (this usage is familiar to Sherlock Holmes"
" fans as well as to literary scholars). ‘*The* canon’ is the body of "
"works in a given field (e.g., works of literature, or of art, or of "
"music) deemed worthwhile for students to study and for scholars to "
"investigate."

"The word ‘canon’ has an interesting history. It derives ultimately from "
"the Greek *κανον* (akin to the English ‘cane’) referring to a reed. Reeds"
" were used for measurement, and in Latin and later Greek the word ‘canon’"
" meant a rule or a standard. The establishment of a canon of scriptures "
"within Christianity was meant to define a standard or a rule for the "
"religion. The above non-techspeak academic usages stem from this instance"
" of a defined and accepted body of work. Alongside this usage was the "
"promulgation of ‘canons’ (‘rules’) for the government of the Catholic "
"Church. The techspeak usages (\"according to religious law\") derive from"
" this use of the Latin ‘canon’."

"Hackers invest this term with a playfulness that makes an ironic contrast"
" with its historical meaning. A true story: One Bob Sjoberg, new at the "
"MIT AI Lab, expressed some annoyance at the incessant use of jargon. Over"
" his loud objections, GLS and RMS made a point of using as much of it as "
"possible in his presence, and eventually it began to sink in. Finally, in"
" one conversation, he used the word canonical in jargon-like fashion "
"without thinking. Steele: \"Aha! We've finally got you talking jargon "
"too!\" Stallman: \"What did he say?\" Steele: \"Bob just used ‘canonical’"
" in the canonical way.\""

"Of course, canonicality depends on context, but it is implicitly defined "
"as the way *hackers* normally expect things to be. Thus, a hacker may "
"claim with a straight face that ‘according to religious law’ is *not* the"
" canonical meaning of canonical."
