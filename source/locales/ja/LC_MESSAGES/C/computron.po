"[common] A notional unit of computing power combining instruction speed "
"and storage capacity, dimensioned roughly in instructions-per-second "
"times megabytes-of-main-store times megabytes-of-mass-storage. \"That "
"machine can't run GNU Emacs, it doesn't have enough computrons!\" This "
"usage is usually found in metaphors that treat computing power as a "
"fungible commodity good, like a crop yield or diesel horsepower. See :ref"
":`bitty-box`\\, :ref:`Get-a-real-computer-`\\, :ref:`toy`\\, "
":ref:`crank`\\."

"A mythical subatomic particle that bears the unit quantity of computation"
" or information, in much the same way that an electron bears one unit of "
"electric charge (see also :ref:`bogon`\\). An elaborate pseudo-scientific"
" theory of computrons has been developed based on the physical fact that "
"the molecules in a solid object move more rapidly as it is heated. It is "
"argued that an object melts because the molecules have lost their "
"information about where they are supposed to be (that is, they have "
"emitted computrons). This explains why computers get so hot and require "
"air conditioning; they use up computrons. Conversely, it should be "
"possible to cool down an object by placing it in the path of a computron "
"beam. It is believed that this may also explain why machines that work at"
" the factory fail in the computer room: the computrons there have been "
"all used up by the other hardware. (The popularity of this theory "
"probably owes something to the *Warlock* stories by Larry Niven, the best"
" known being *What Good is a Glass Dagger?*\\, in which magic is fueled "
"by an exhaustible natural resource called *mana*\\.)"
