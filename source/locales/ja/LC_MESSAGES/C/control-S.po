"\"Stop talking for a second.\" From the ASCII DC3 or XOFF character (the "
"pronunciation /X-of/ is therefore also used). Control-S differs from "
":ref:`control-O` in that the person is asked to stop talking (perhaps "
"because you are on the phone) but will be allowed to continue when you're"
" ready to listen to him â€” as opposed to control-O, which has more of the "
"meaning of \"Shut up.\" Considered silly."
