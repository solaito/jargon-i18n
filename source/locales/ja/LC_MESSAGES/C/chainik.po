"[Russian, literally \"teapot\"] Almost synonymous with :ref:`muggle`\\. "
"Implies both ignorance and a certain amount of willingness to learn, but "
"does not necessarily imply as little experience or short exposure time as"
" :ref:`newbie` and is not as derogatory as :ref:`luser`\\. Both a novice "
"user and someone using a system for a long time without any understanding"
" of the internals can be referred to as chainiks. Very widespread term in"
" Russian hackish, often used in an English context by Russian-speaking "
"hackers esp. in Israel (e.g. \"Our new colleague is a complete "
"chainik\"). FidoNet discussion groups often had a \"chainik\" subsection "
"for newbies and, well, old chainiks (eg. su.asm.chainik, "
"ru.linux.chainik, ru.html.chainik). Public projects often have a chainik "
"mailing list to keep the chainiks off the developers' and experienced "
"users' discussions. Today, the word is slowly slipping into mainstream "
"Russian due to the Russian translation of the popular yellow-black "
"covered \"foobar for dummies\" series, which (correctly) uses \"chainik\""
" for \"dummy\", but its frequent (though not excessive) use is still "
"characteristic hacker-speak."
