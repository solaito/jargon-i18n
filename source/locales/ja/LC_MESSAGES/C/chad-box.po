"A metal box about the size of a lunchbox (or in some models a large "
"wastebasket), for collecting the :ref:`chad` (sense 2) that accumulated "
"in :ref:`Iron-Age` card punches. You had to open the covers of the card "
"punch periodically and empty the chad box. The :ref:`bit-bucket` was "
"notionally the equivalent device in the CPU enclosure, which was "
"typically across the room in another great gray-and-blue box."
