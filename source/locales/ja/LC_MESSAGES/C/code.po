"n\\. The stuff that software writers write, either in source form or "
"after translation by a compiler or assembler. Often used in opposition to"
" \"data\", which is the stuff that code operates on. Among hackers this "
"is a mass noun, as in \"How much code does it take to do a :ref:`bubble-"
"sort`\\? \", or \"The code is loaded at the high end of RAM.\" Among "
"scientific programmers it is sometimes a count noun equilvalent to "
"\"program\"; thus they may speak of \"codes\" in the plural. Anyone "
"referring to software as \"the software codes\" is probably a "
":ref:`newbie` or a :ref:`suit`\\."

"v\\. To write code. In this sense, always refers to source code rather "
"than compiled. \"I coded an Emacs clone in two hours!\" This verb is a "
"bit of a cultural marker associated with the Unix and minicomputer "
"traditions (and lately Linux); people within that culture prefer v. "
"‘code’ to v. ‘program’ whereas outside it the reverse is normally true."
