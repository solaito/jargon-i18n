"[Usenet] n. fortuitous typo for co-worker, widely used in Usenet, with "
"perhaps a hint that orking cows is illegal. This term was popularized by "
"Scott Adams (the creator of :ref:`Dilbert`\\) but already appears in the "
"January 1996 version of the :ref:`scary-devil-monastery` FAQ, and has "
"been traced back to a 1989 :ref:`sig-block`\\. Compare :ref:`hing`\\, "
":ref:`grilf`\\, :ref:`filk`\\, :ref:`newsfroup`\\."
