"A handle, transaction ID, or other token of agreement between cooperating"
" programs. \"I give him a packet, he gives me back a cookie.\" The claim "
"check you get from a dry-cleaning shop is a perfect mundane example of a "
"cookie; the only thing it's useful for is to relate a later transaction "
"to this one (so you get the same clothes back). Syn. :ref:`magic-"
"cookie`\\; see also :ref:`fortune-cookie`\\. Now mainstream in the "
"specific sense of web-browser cookies."
