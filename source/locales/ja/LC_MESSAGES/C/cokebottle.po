"Any very unusual character, particularly one you can't type because it "
"isn't on your keyboard. MIT people used to complain about the ‘control-"
"meta-cokebottle’ commands at SAIL, and SAIL people complained right back "
"about the ‘escape-escape-cokebottle’ commands at MIT. After the demise of"
" the :ref:`space-cadet-keyboard`\\, cokebottle faded away as serious "
"usage, but was often invoked humorously to describe an (unspecified) "
"weird or non-intuitive keystroke command. It may be due for a second "
"inning, however. The OSF/Motif window manager, :manpage:`mwm(1)`\\, has a"
" reserved keystroke for switching to the default set of keybindings and "
"behavior. This keystroke is (believe it or not) ‘control-meta-bang’ (see "
":ref:`bang`\\). Since the exclamation point looks a lot like an upside "
"down Coke bottle, Motif hackers have begun referring to this keystroke as"
" cokebottle. See also :ref:`quadruple-bucky`\\."
