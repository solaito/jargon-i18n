"Processor logic cycles, so called because each generally corresponds to "
"one clock pulse in the processor's timing. The relative execution times "
"of instructions on a machine are usually discussed in clocks rather than "
"absolute fractions of a second; one good reason for this is that clock "
"speeds for various models of the machine may increase as technology "
"improves, and it is usually the relative times one is interested in when "
"discussing the instruction set. Compare :ref:`cycle`\\, :ref:`jiffy`\\."
