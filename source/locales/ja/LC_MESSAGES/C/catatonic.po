"Describes a condition of suspended animation in which something is so "
":ref:`wedged` or :ref:`hung` that it makes no response. If you are typing"
" on a terminal and suddenly the computer doesn't even echo the letters "
"back to the screen as you type, let alone do what you're asking it to do,"
" then the computer is suffering from catatonia (possibly because it has "
"crashed). \"There I was in the middle of a winning game of :ref:`nethack`"
" and it went catatonic on me! Aaargh!\" Compare :ref:`buzz`\\."
