"The tray of a CD-ROM drive, or by extension the CD drive itself. So "
"called because of a common tech support legend about the idiot who called"
" to complain that the cup holder on his computer broke. A joke program "
"was once distributed around the net called \"cupholder.exe\", which when "
"run simply extended the CD drive tray. The humor of this was of course "
"lost on people whose drive had a slot or a caddy instead."
