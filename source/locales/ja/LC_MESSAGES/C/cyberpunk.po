"[orig. by SF writer Bruce Bethke and/or editor Gardner Dozois] A subgenre"
" of SF launched in 1982 by William Gibson's epoch-making novel "
"*Neuromancer* (though its roots go back through Vernor Vinge's *True "
"Names* (see the :ref:`Bibliography<bibliography>` in Appendix C) to John "
"Brunner's 1975 novel *The Shockwave Rider*\\). Gibson's near-total "
"ignorance of computers and the present-day hacker culture enabled him to "
"speculate about the role of computers and hackers in the future in ways "
"hackers have since found both irritatingly naïve and tremendously "
"stimulating. Gibson's work was widely imitated, in particular by the "
"short-lived but innovative *Max Headroom* TV series. See "
":ref:`cyberspace`\\, :ref:`ice`\\, :ref:`jack-in`\\, :ref:`go-"
"flatline`\\."

"Since 1990 or so, popular culture has included a movement or fashion "
"trend that calls itself ‘cyberpunk’, associated especially with the "
"rave/techno subculture. Hackers have mixed feelings about this. On the "
"one hand, self-described cyberpunks too often seem to be shallow "
"trendoids in black leather who have substituted enthusiastic blathering "
"about technology for actually learning and *doing* it. Attitude is no "
"substitute for competence. On the other hand, at least cyberpunks are "
"excited about the right things and properly respectful of hacking talent "
"in those who have it. The general consensus is to tolerate them politely "
"in hopes that they'll attract people who grow into being true hackers."
