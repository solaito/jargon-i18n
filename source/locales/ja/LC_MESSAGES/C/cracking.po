"[very common] The act of breaking into a computer system; what a "
":ref:`cracker` does. Contrary to widespread myth, this does not usually "
"involve some mysterious leap of hackerly brilliance, but rather "
"persistence and the dogged repetition of a handful of fairly well-known "
"tricks that exploit common weaknesses in the security of target systems. "
"Accordingly, most crackers are incompetent as hackers. This entry used to"
" say 'mediocre', but the spread of :ref:`rootkit` and other automated "
"cracking has depressed the average level of skill among crackers."
