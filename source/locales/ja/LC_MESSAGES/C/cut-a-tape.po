"To write a software or document distribution on magnetic tape for "
"shipment. Has nothing to do with physically cutting the medium! Early "
"versions of this lexicon claimed that one never analogously speaks of "
"‘cutting a disk’, but this has since been reported as live usage. Related"
" slang usages are mainstream business's ‘cut a check’, the recording "
"industry's ‘cut a record’, and the military's ‘cut an order’."

"All of these usages reflect physical processes in obsolete recording and "
"duplication technologies. The first stage in manufacturing an old-style "
"vinyl record involved cutting grooves in a stamping die with a precision "
"lathe. More mundanely, the dominant technology for mass duplication of "
"paper documents in pre-photocopying days involved \"cutting a stencil\", "
"punching away portions of the wax overlay on a silk screen. More "
"directly, paper tape with holes punched in it was an important early "
"storage medium. See also :ref:`burn-a-CD`\\."
