"Notionally, the cause of :ref:`bit-rot`\\. However, this is a semi-"
"independent usage that may be invoked as a humorous way to "
":ref:`handwave` away any minor :ref:`randomness` that doesn't seem worth "
"the bother of investigating. \"Hey, Eric â€” I just got a burst of garbage "
"on my :ref:`tube`\\, where did that come from?\" \"Cosmic rays, I "
"guess.\" Compare :ref:`sunspots`\\, :ref:`phase-of-the-moon`\\. The "
"British seem to prefer the usage cosmic showers; alpha particles is also "
"heard, because stray alpha particles passing through a memory chip can "
"cause single-bit errors (this becomes increasingly more likely as memory "
"sizes and densities increase)."

"Factual note: Alpha particles cause bit rot, cosmic rays do not (except "
"occasionally in spaceborne computers). Intel could not explain random bit"
" drops in their early chips, and one hypothesis was cosmic rays. So they "
"created the World's Largest Lead Safe, using 25 tons of the stuff, and "
"used two identical boards for testing. One was placed in the safe, one "
"outside. The hypothesis was that if cosmic rays were causing the bit "
"drops, they should see a statistically significant difference between the"
" error rates on the two boards. They did not observe such a difference. "
"Further investigation demonstrated conclusively that the bit drops were "
"due to alpha particle emissions from thorium (and to a much lesser degree"
" uranium) in the encapsulation material. Since it is impossible to "
"eliminate these radioactives (they are uniformly distributed through the "
"earth's crust, with the statistically insignificant exception of uranium "
"lodes) it became obvious that one has to design memories to withstand "
"these hits."
