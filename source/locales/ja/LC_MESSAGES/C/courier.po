"[BBS & cracker cultures] A person who distributes newly cracked "
":ref:`warez`\\, as opposed to a :ref:`server` who makes them available "
"for download or a :ref:`leech` who merely downloads them. Hackers "
"recognize this term but don't use it themselves, as the act is not part "
"of their culture. See also :ref:`warez-d00dz`\\, :ref:`cracker`\\, "
