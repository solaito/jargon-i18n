"Hacker jargon as spoken in English outside the U.S., esp. in the British "
"Commonwealth. It is reported that Commonwealth speakers are more likely "
"to pronounce truncations like ‘char’ and ‘soc’, etc., as spelled (/char/,"
" /sok/), as opposed to American /keir/ and /sohsh/. Dots in "
":ref:`newsgroup` names (especially two-component names) tend to be "
"pronounced more often (so soc.wibble is /sok dot wib´l/ rather than "
"/sohsh wib´l/)."

"Preferred :ref:`metasyntactic-variable`\\s include :ref:`blurgle`\\, "
":code:`eek`\\, :code:`ook`\\, :code:`frodo`\\, and :code:`bilbo`\\; "
":ref:`wibble`\\, :code:`wobble`\\, and in emergencies :code:`wubble`\\; "
":code:`flob`\\, :code:`banana`\\, :code:`tom`\\, :code:`dick`\\, "
":code:`harry`\\, :code:`wombat`\\, :code:`frog`\\, :ref:`fish`\\, "
":ref:`womble` and so on and on (see :ref:`foo`\\, sense 4). Alternatives "
"to verb doubling include suffixes -o-rama, frenzy (as in feeding frenzy),"
" and city (examples: \"barf city!\" \"hack-o-rama!\" \"core dump frenzy! "
"\")."

"All the generic differences within the anglophone world inevitably show "
"themselves in the associated hackish dialects. The Greek letters beta and"
" zeta are usually pronounced /bee´t\\@/ and /zee´t\\@/; meta may also be "
"pronounced /mee´t\\@/. Various punctuators (and even letters - Z is "
"called ‘zed’, not ‘zee’) are named differently: most crucially, for "
"hackish, where Americans use ‘parens’, ‘brackets’ and \\\\`braces' for "
"(), [] and {}, Commonwealth English uses ‘brackets’, ‘square brackets’ "
"and ‘curly brackets’, though ‘parentheses’ may be used for the first; the"
" exclamation mark, ‘!’, is called pling rather than bang and the pound "
"sign, ‘#’, is called hash; furthermore, the term ‘the pound sign’ is "
"understood to mean the £ (of course). Canadian hacker slang, as with "
"mainstream language, mixes American and British usages about evenly."
