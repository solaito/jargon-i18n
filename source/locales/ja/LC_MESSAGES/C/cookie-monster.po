"[from the children's TV program *Sesame Street*\\] Any of a family of "
"early (1970s) hacks reported on :ref:`TOPS-10`\\, :ref:`ITS`\\, "
":ref:`Multics`\\, and elsewhere that would lock up either the victim's "
"terminal (on a timesharing machine) or the :ref:`console` (on a batch "
":ref:`mainframe`\\), repeatedly demanding \"I WANT A COOKIE\". The "
"required responses ranged in complexity from \"COOKIE\" through \"HAVE A "
"COOKIE\" and upward. Folklorist Jan Brunvand (see :ref:`FOAF`\\) has "
"described these programs as urban legends (implying they probably never "
"existed) but they existed, all right, in several different versions. See "
"also :ref:`wabbit`\\. Interestingly, the term cookie monster appears to "
"be a :ref:`retcon`\\; the original term was :ref:`cookie-bear`\\."
