"Ancient crufty hardware or software that is kept obstinately alive by "
"forces beyond the control of the hackers at a site. Like :ref:`dusty-"
"deck` or :ref:`gonkulator`\\, but connotes that the thing described is "
"not just an irritation but an active menace to health and sanity. "
"\"Mostly we code new stuff in C, but they pay us to maintain one big "
"FORTRAN II application from nineteen-sixty-X that's a real crawling "

"This usage is almost certainly derived from the fiction of H.P. "
"Lovecraft. Lovecraft may never have used the exact phrase \"crawling "
"horror\" in his writings, but one of the fearsome Elder Gods that he "
"wrote extensively about was Nyarlethotep, who had as an epithet \"The "
"Crawling Chaos\". Certainly the extreme, even melodramatic horror of his "
"characters at the weird monsters they encounter, even to the point of "
"going insane with fear, is what hackers are referring to with this phrase"
" when they use it for horribly bad code. Compare :ref:`cthulhic`\\."
