"vi\\. To process, usually in a time-consuming or complicated way. "
"Connotes an essentially trivial operation that is nonetheless painful to "
"perform. The pain may be due to the triviality's being embedded in a loop"
" from 1 to 1,000,000,000. \"FORTRAN programs do mostly :ref:`number-"
"crunching`\\.\""

"vt\\. To reduce the size of a file by a complicated scheme that produces "
"bit configurations completely unrelated to the original data, such as by "
"a Huffman code. (The file ends up looking something like a paper document"
" would if somebody crunched the paper into a wad.) Since such compression"
" usually takes more computations than simpler methods such as run-length "
"encoding, the term is doubly appropriate. (This meaning is usually used "
"in the construction file crunch(ing) to distinguish it from :ref:`number-"
"crunching`\\.) See :ref:`compress`\\."

"vt\\. To squeeze program source into a minimum-size representation that "
"will still compile or execute. The term came into being specifically for "
"a famous program on the BBC micro that crunched BASIC source in order to "
"make it run more quickly (it was a wholly interpretive BASIC, so the "
"number of characters mattered). :ref:`Obfuscated-C-Contest` entries are "
"often crunched; see the first example under that entry."
