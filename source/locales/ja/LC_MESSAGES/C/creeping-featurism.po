"Describes a systematic tendency to load more :ref:`chrome` and "
":ref:`feature`\\s onto systems at the expense of whatever elegance they "
"may have possessed when originally designed. See also :ref:`feeping-"
"creaturism`\\. \"You know, the main problem with :ref:`BSD` Unix has "
"always been creeping featurism.\""

"More generally, the tendency for anything complicated to become even more"
" complicated because people keep saying \"Gee, it would be even better if"
" it had this feature too\". (See :ref:`feature`\\.) The result is usually"
" a patchwork because it grew one ad-hoc step at a time, rather than being"
" planned. Planning is a lot of work, but it's easy to add just one extra "
"little feature to help someone ... and then another ... and another.... "
"When creeping featurism gets out of hand, it's like a cancer. The GNU "
"hello program, intended to illustrate :ref:`GNU` command-line switch and "
"coding conventions, is also a wonderful parody of creeping featurism; the"
" distribution changelog is particularly funny. Usually this term is used "
"to describe computer programs, but it could also be said of the federal "
"government, the IRS 1040 form, and new cars. A similar phenomenon "
"sometimes afflicts conscious redesigns; see :ref:`second-system-"
"effect`\\. See also :ref:`creeping-elegance`\\."
