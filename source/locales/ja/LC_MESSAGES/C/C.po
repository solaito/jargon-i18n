"The name of a programming language designed by Dennis Ritchie during the "
"early 1970s and immediately used to reimplement :ref:`Unix`\\; so called "
"because many features derived from an earlier compiler named ‘B’ in "
"commemoration of *its* parent, BCPL. (BCPL was in turn descended from an "
"earlier Algol-derived language, CPL.) Before Bjarne Stroustrup settled "
"the question by designing :ref:`C-plus-plus`\\, there was a humorous "
"debate over whether C's successor should be named ‘D’ or ‘P’. C became "
"immensely popular outside Bell Labs after about 1980 and is now the "
"dominant language in systems and microcomputer applications programming. "
"C is often described, with a mixture of fondness and disdain varying "
"according to the speaker, as \"a language that combines all the elegance "
"and power of assembly language with all the readability and "
"maintainability of assembly language\" See also :ref:`languages-of-"
"choice`\\, :ref:`indent-style`\\."
