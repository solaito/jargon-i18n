"A spectacular crash, in the mode of the conclusion of the car-chase scene"
" in the movie *Bullitt* and many subsequent imitators (compare :ref:`die-"
"horribly`\\). The construction crash-and-burn machine is reported for a "
"computer used exclusively for alpha or :ref:`beta` testing, or "
"reproducing bugs (i.e., not for development). The implication is that it "
"wouldn't be such a disaster if that machine crashed, since only the "
"testers would be inconvenienced."
