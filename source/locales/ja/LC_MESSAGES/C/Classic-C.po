"first edition of :ref:`K-ampersand-R`\\, with some small additions. It is"
" also known as ‘K&R C’. The name came into use while C was being "
"standardized by the ANSI X3J11 committee. Also ‘C Classic’."

"An analogous construction is sometimes applied elsewhere: thus, ‘X "
"Classic’, where X = Star Trek (referring to the original TV series) or X "
"= PC (referring to IBM's ISA-bus machines as opposed to the PS/2 series)."
" This construction is especially used of product series in which the "
"newer versions are considered serious losers relative to the older ones."
