"[Control Program/Monitor; later :ref:`retcon`\\ned to Control Program for"
" Microcomputers] An early microcomputer :ref:`OS` written by hacker Gary "
"Kildall for 8080- and Z80-based machines, very popular in the late 1970s "
"but virtually wiped out by MS-DOS after the release of the IBM PC in "
"1981. Legend has it that Kildall's company blew its chance to write the "
"OS for the IBM PC because Kildall decided to spend a day IBM's reps "
"wanted to meet with him enjoying the perfect flying weather in his "
"private plane (another variant has it that Gary's wife was much more "
"interested in packing her suitcases for an upcoming vacation than in "
"clinching a deal with IBM). Many of CP/M's features and conventions "
"strongly resemble those of early :ref:`DEC` operating systems such as "
":ref:`TOPS-10`\\, OS/8, RSTS, and RSX-11. See :ref:`MS-DOS`\\, :ref"
":`operating-system`\\."
