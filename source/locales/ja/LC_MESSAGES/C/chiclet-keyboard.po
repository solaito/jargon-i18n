"A keyboard with a small, flat rectangular or lozenge-shaped rubber or "
"plastic keys that look like pieces of chewing gum. (Chiclets is the brand"
" name of a variety of chewing gum that does in fact resemble the keys of "
"chiclet keyboards.) Used esp. to describe the original IBM PCjr keyboard."
" Vendors unanimously liked these because they were cheap, and a lot of "
"early portable and laptop products got launched using them. Customers "
"rejected the idea with almost equal unanimity, and chiclets are not often"
" seen on anything larger than a digital watch any more."
