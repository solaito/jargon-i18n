"Syn. :ref:`chad`\\. [obs.] Though this term was common at one time, this "
"use of punched-card chad is not a good idea, as the pieces are stiff and "
"have sharp corners that could injure the eyes. GLS reports that he once "
"attended a wedding at MIT during which he and a few other guests "
"enthusiastically threw chad instead of rice. The groom later grumbled "
"that he and his bride had spent most of the evening trying to get the "
"stuff out of their hair."

"[2001 update: this term has passed out of use for two reasons; (1) the "
"stuff it describes is now quite rare, and (2) the term :ref:`chad`\\, "
"which was half-forgotten in 1990, has enjoyed a revival. â€”ESR]"
