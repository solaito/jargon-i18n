"Any of the editions of the *Chemical Rubber Company Handbook of Chemistry"
" and Physics*\\; there are other CRC handbooks, such as the *CRC Standard"
" Mathematical Tables and Formulae*\\, but \"the\" CRC handbook is the "
"chemistry and physics reference. It is massive tome full of mathematical "
"tables, physical constants of thousands of alloys and chemical compounds,"
" dielectric strengths, vapor pressure, resistivity, and the like. Hackers"
" have remarkably little actual use for these sorts of arcana, but are "
"such information junkies that a large percentage of them acquire copies "
"anyway and would feel vaguely bereft if they couldn't look up the "
"magnetic susceptibility of potassium permanganate at a moment's notice. "
"On hackers' bookshelves, the CRC handbook is rather likely to keep "
"company with an unabridged Oxford English Dictionary and a good atlas."
