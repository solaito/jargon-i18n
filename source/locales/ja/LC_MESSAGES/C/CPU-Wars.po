"A 1979 large-format comic by Chas Andres chronicling the attempts of the "
"brainwashed androids of IPM (Impossible to Program Machines) to conquer "
"and destroy the peaceful denizens of HEC (Human Engineered Computers). "
"This rather transparent allegory featured many references to "
":ref:`ADVENT` and the immortal line \"Eat flaming death, minicomputer "
"mongrels!\" (uttered, of course, by an IPM stormtrooper). The whole "
"shebang is now `available on the Web "
"<http://www.e-pix.com/CPUWARS/cpuwars.html>`_."

"It is alleged that the author subsequently received a letter of "
"appreciation on IBM company stationery from the head of IBM's Thomas J. "
"Watson Research Laboratories (at that time one of the few islands of true"
" hackerdom in the IBM archipelago). The lower loop of the B in the IBM "
"logo, it is said, had been carefully whited out. See :ref:`eat-flaming-"
"death`\\."
