"A style of (incompetent) programming dominated by ritual inclusion of "
"code or program structures that serve no real purpose. A cargo cult "
"programmer will usually explain the extra code as a way of working around"
" some bug encountered in the past, but usually neither the bug nor the "
"reason the code apparently avoided the bug was ever fully understood "
"(compare :ref:`shotgun-debugging`\\, :ref:`voodoo-programming`\\)."

"The term ‘cargo cult’ is a reference to aboriginal religions that grew up"
" in the South Pacific after World War II. The practices of these cults "
"center on building elaborate mockups of airplanes and military style "
"landing strips in the hope of bringing the return of the god-like "
"airplanes that brought such marvelous cargo during the war. Hackish usage"
" probably derives from Richard Feynman's characterization of certain "
"practices as \"cargo cult science\" in his book *Surely You're Joking, "
"Mr. Feynman!* (W. W. Norton & Co, New York 1985, ISBN 0-393-01921-7)."
