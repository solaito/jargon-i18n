"Synonym for ‘penis’ used in :samp:`alt.tasteless` and popularized by the "
"denizens thereof. They say: \"We think maybe it's from Middle English but"
" we're all too damned lazy to check the OED.\" [I'm not. It isn't. —ESR] "
"This term is alleged to have been inherited through 1960s underground "
"comics, and to have been recently sighted in the Beavis and Butthead "
"cartoons. Speakers of the Hindi, Bengali and Gujarati languages have "
"confirmed that ‘choad’ is in fact an Indian vernacular word equivalent to"
" ‘fuck’; it is therefore likely to have entered English slang via the "
"British Raj."
