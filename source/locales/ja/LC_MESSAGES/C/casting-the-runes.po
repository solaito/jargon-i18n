"What a :ref:`guru` does when you ask him or her to run a particular "

"when nobody can ever see what the guru is doing different from what J. "

"A correspondent from England tells us that one of ICL's most talented "
"systems designers used to be called out occasionally to service machines "
"which the :ref:`field-circus` had given up on. Since he knew the design "
"inside out, he could often find faults simply by listening to a quick "
"outline of the symptoms. He used to play on this by going to some site "
"where the field circus had just spent the last two weeks solid trying to "
"find a fault, and spreading a diagram of the system out on a table top. "
"He'd then shake some chicken bones and cast them over the diagram, peer "
"at the bones intently for a minute, and then tell them that a certain "
"module needed replacing. The system would start working again immediately"
" upon the replacement."
