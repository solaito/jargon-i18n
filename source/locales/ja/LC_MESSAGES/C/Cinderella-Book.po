"[CMU] *Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation*\\, by"
" John Hopcroft and Jeffrey Ullman, (Addison-Wesley, 1979). So called "
"because the cover depicts a girl (putatively Cinderella) sitting in front"
" of a Rube Goldberg device and holding a rope coming out of it. On the "
"back cover, the device is in shambles after she has (inevitably) pulled "
"on the rope. See also :ref:`book-titles`\\."
