"Poorly built, possibly over-complex. The :ref:`canonical` example is "
"\"This is standard old crufty :ref:`DEC` software\". In fact, one "
"fanciful theory of the origin of crufty holds that was originally a "
"mutation of ‘crusty’ applied to DEC software so old that the ‘s’ "

"This term is one of the oldest in the jargon and no one is sure of its "
"etymology, but it is suggestive that there is a Cruft Hall at Harvard "
"University which is part of the old physics building; it's said to have "
"been the physics department's radar lab during WWII. To this day (early "
"1993) the windows appear to be full of random techno-junk. MIT or Lincoln"
" Labs people may well have coined the term as a knock on the competition."
