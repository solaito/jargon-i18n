"[Usenet; very common] To post a single article simultaneously to several "
"newsgroups. Distinguished from posting the article repeatedly, once to "
"each newsgroup, which causes people to see it multiple times (which is "
"very bad form). Gratuitous cross-posting without a Followup-To line "
"directing responses to a single followup group is frowned upon, as it "
"tends to cause :ref:`followup` articles to go to inappropriate newsgroups"
" when people respond to various parts of the original posting."
