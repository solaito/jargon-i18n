"[University of Florida] 16 or 18 bits (half of a machine word). This term"
" was used by FORTH hackers during the late 1970s/early 1980s; it is said "
"to have been archaic then, and may now be obsolete. It was coined in "
"revolt against the promiscuous use of ‘word’ for anything between 16 and "
"32 bits; ‘word’ has an additional special meaning for FORTH hacks that "
"made the overloading intolerable. For similar reasons, /gaw´bl/ (spelled "
"‘gawble’ or possibly ‘gawbul’) was in use as a term for 32 or 48 bits "
"(presumably a full machine word, but our sources are unclear on this). "
"These terms are more easily understood if one thinks of them as faithful "
"phonetic spellings of ‘chomp’ and ‘gobble’ pronounced in a Florida or "
"other Southern U.S. dialect. For general discussion of similar terms, see"
" :ref:`nybble`\\."
