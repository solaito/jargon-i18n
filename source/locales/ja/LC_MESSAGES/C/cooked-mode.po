"[Unix, by opposition from :ref:`raw-mode`\\] The normal character-input "
"mode, with interrupts enabled and with erase, kill and other special-"
"character interpretations performed directly by the tty driver. Oppose "
":ref:`raw-mode`\\, :ref:`rare-mode`\\. This term is techspeak under Unix "
"but jargon elsewhere; other operating systems often have similar mode "
"distinctions, and the raw/rare/cooked way of describing them has spread "
"widely along with the C language and other Unix exports. Most generally, "
"cooked mode may refer to any mode of a system that does extensive "
"preprocessing before presenting data to a program."
