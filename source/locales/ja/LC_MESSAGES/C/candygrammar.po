"A programming-language grammar that is mostly :ref:`syntactic-sugar`\\; "
"the term is also a play on ‘candygram’. :ref:`COBOL`\\, Apple's Hypertalk"
" language, and a lot of the so-called ‘4GL’ database languages share this"
" property. The usual intent of such designs is that they be as English-"
"like as possible, on the theory that they will then be easier for "
"unskilled people to program. This intention comes to grief on the reality"
" that syntax isn't what makes programming hard; it's the mental effort "
"and organization required to specify an algorithm precisely that costs. "
"Thus the invariable result is that ‘candygrammar’ languages are just as "
"difficult to program in as terser ones, and far more painful for the "
"experienced hacker."

"[The overtones from the old Chevy Chase skit on Saturday Night Live "
"should not be overlooked. This was a *Jaws* parody. Someone lurking "
"outside an apartment door tries all kinds of bogus ways to get the "
"occupant to open up, while ominous music plays in the background. The "
"last attempt is a half-hearted \"Candygram!\" When the door is opened, a "
"shark bursts in and chomps the poor occupant. [There is a similar gag in "
"\"Blazing Saddles\" —ESR] There is a moral here for those attracted to "
"candygrammars. Note that, in many circles, pretty much the same ones who "
"remember Monty Python sketches, all it takes is the word \"Candygram! \","
" suitably timed, to get people rolling on the floor. — GLS]"
