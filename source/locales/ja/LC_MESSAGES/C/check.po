"A hardware-detected error condition, most commonly used to refer to "
"actual hardware failures rather than software-induced traps. E.g., a "
"parity check is the result of a hardware-detected parity error. Recorded "

"problems. For example, the term child check has been used to refer to the"
" problems caused by a small child who is curious to know what happens "
"when s/he presses all the cute buttons on a computer's console (of "
"course, this particular problem could have been prevented with :ref"
":`molly-guard`\\s)."
