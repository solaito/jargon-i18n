"The confetti-like paper bits punched out of cards or paper tape; this has"
" also been called chaff, computer confetti, and keypunch droppings. It's "
"reported that this was very old Army slang (associated with "
"teletypewriters before the computer era), and has been occasionally "
"sighted in directions for punched-card vote tabulators long after it "
"passed out of live use among computer programmers in the late 1970s. This"
" sense of ‘chad’ returned to the mainstream during the finale of the "
"hotly disputed U.S. presidential election in 2000 via stories about the "
"Florida vote recounts. Note however that in the revived mainstream usage "
"chad is not a mass noun and ‘a chad’ is a single piece of the stuff."

"There is an urban legend that chad (sense 2) derives from the Chadless "
"keypunch (named for its inventor), which cut little u-shaped tabs in the "
"card to make a hole when the tab folded back, rather than punching out a "
"circle/rectangle; it was clear that if the Chadless keypunch didn't make "
"them, then the stuff that other keypunches made had to be ‘chad’. "
"However, serious attempts to track down \"Chadless\" as a personal name "
"or U.S. trademark have failed, casting doubt on this etymology — and the "
"U.S. Patent Classification System uses \"chadless\" (small c) as an "
"adjective, suggesting that \"chadless\" derives from \"chad\" and not the"
" other way around. There is another legend that the word was originally "
"acronymic, standing for \"Card Hole Aggregate Debris\", but this has all "
"the earmarks of a :ref:`backronym`\\. It has also been noted that the "
"word \"chad\" is Scots dialect for gravel, but nobody has proposed any "
"plausible reason that card chaff should be thought of as gravel. None of "
"these etymologies is really plausible."
