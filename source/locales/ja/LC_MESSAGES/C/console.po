"The operator's station of a :ref:`mainframe`\\. In times past, this was a"
" privileged location that conveyed godlike powers to anyone with fingers "
"on its keys. Under Unix and other modern timesharing OSes, such "
"privileges are guarded by passwords instead, and the console is just the "
":ref:`tty` the system was booted from. Some of the mystique remains, "
"however, and it is traditional for sysadmins to post urgent messages to "
"all users from the console (on Unix, /dev/console)."
