"[IRC] The basic unit of discussion on :ref:`IRC`\\. Once one joins a "
"channel, everything one types is read by others on that channel. Channels"
" are named with strings that begin with a ‘#’ sign and can have topic "
"descriptions (which are generally irrelevant to the actual subject of "
"discussion). Some notable channels are :code:`#initgame`\\, "
":code:`#hottub`\\, :code:`callahans`\\, and :code:`#report`\\. At times "
"of international crisis, :code:`#report` has hundreds of members, some of"
" whom take turns listening to various news services and typing in "
"summaries of the news, or in some cases, giving first-hand accounts of "
"the action (e.g., Scud missile attacks in Tel Aviv during the Gulf War in"
" 1991)."
