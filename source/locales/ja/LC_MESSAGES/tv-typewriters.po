"Here is a true story about a glass tty: One day an MIT hacker was in a "
"motorcycle accident and broke his leg. He had to stay in the hospital "
"quite a while, and got restless because he couldn't :ref:`hack`\\. Two of"
" his friends therefore took a terminal and a modem for it to the "
"hospital, so that he could use the computer by telephone from his "
"hospital bed."

"Now this happened some years before the spread of home computers, and "
"computer terminals were not a familiar sight to the average person. When "
"the two friends got to the hospital, a guard stopped them and asked what "
"they were carrying. They explained that they wanted to take a computer "
"terminal to their friend who was a patient."

"The guard got out his list of things that patients were permitted to have"
" in their rooms: TV, radio, electric razor, typewriter, tape player, ... "
"no computer terminals. Computer terminals weren't on the list, so the "
"guard wouldn't let it in. Rules are rules, you know. (This guard was "
"clearly a :ref:`droid`\\.)"

"Fair enough, said the two friends, and they left again. They were "
"frustrated, of course, because they knew that the terminal was as "
"harmless as a TV or anything else on the list... which gave them an idea."

"The next day they returned, and the same thing happened: a guard stopped "
"them and asked what they were carrying. They said: \"This is a TV "
"typewriter!\" The guard was skeptical, so they plugged it in and "
"demonstrated it. \"See? You just type on the keyboard and what you type "
"shows up on the TV screen.\" Now the guard didn't stop to think about how"
" utterly useless a typewriter would be that didn't produce any paper "
"copies of what you typed; but this was clearly a TV typewriter, no doubt "
"about it. So he checked his list: “A TV is all right, a typewriter is all"
" right ... okay, take it on in!”"

"[Historical note: Many years ago, *PopularElectronics* published solder-"
"it-yourself plans for a TV typewriter. Despite the essential uselessness "
"of the device, it was an enormously popular project. Steve Ciarcia, the "
"man behind *Byte* magazine's \"Circuit Cellar\" feature, resurrected this"
" ghost in one of his books of the early 1980s. He ascribed its popularity"
" (no doubt correctly) to the feeling of power the builder could achieve "
"by being able to decide himself what would be shown on the TV. And, in "
"fact, the device was not entirely useless; when combined with a modem "
"board, it became a crude but serviceable terminal. —ESR]"
