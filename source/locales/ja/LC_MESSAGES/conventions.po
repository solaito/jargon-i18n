"We follow the ‘logical’ quoting convention described in the Writing Style"
" section above. In addition, we reserve double quotes for actual excerpts"
" of text or (sometimes invented) speech. Scare quotes (which mark a word "
"being used in a nonstandard way), and philosopher's quotes (which turn an"
" utterance into the string of letters or words that name it) are both "
"rendered with single quotes."

"References such as :manpage:`malloc(3)` and :manpage:`patch(1)` are to "
"Unix facilities (some of which, such as :manpage:`patch(1)`\\, are "
"actually open source distributed over Usenet). The Unix manuals use "
"``foo(n)`` to refer to item foo in section (``n``\\) of the manual, where"
" ``n=1`` is utilities, ``n=2`` is system calls, ``n=3`` is C library "
"routines, ``n=6`` is games, and ``n=8`` (where present) is system "
"administration utilities. Sections 4, 5, and 7 of the manuals have "
"changed roles frequently and in any case are not referred to in any of "
