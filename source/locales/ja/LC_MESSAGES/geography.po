"In the United States, hackerdom revolves on a Bay Area-to-Boston axis; "
"about half of the hard core seems to live within a hundred miles of "
"Cambridge (Massachusetts) or Berkeley (California), although there are "
"significant contingents in Los Angeles, in the Pacific Northwest, and "
"around Washington DC. Hackers tend to cluster around large cities, "
"especially ‘university towns’ such as the Raleigh-Durham area in North "
"Carolina or Princeton, New Jersey (this may simply reflect the fact that "
"many are students or ex-students living near their alma maters)."
