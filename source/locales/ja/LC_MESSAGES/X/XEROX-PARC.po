"The famed Palo Alto Research Center. For more than a decade, from the "
"early 1970s into the mid-1980s, PARC yielded an astonishing volume of "
"groundbreaking hardware and software innovations. The modern mice, "
"windows, and icons style of software interface was invented there. So was"
" the laser printer and the local-area network; and PARC's series of D "
"machines anticipated the powerful personal computers of the 1980s by a "
"decade. Sadly, the prophets at PARC were without honor in their own "
"company, so much so that it became a standard joke to describe PARC as a "
"place that specialized in developing brilliant ideas for everyone else."
