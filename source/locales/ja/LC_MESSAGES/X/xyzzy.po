"[from the ADVENT game] The :ref:`canonical` ‘magic word’. This comes from"
" :ref:`ADVENT`\\, in which the idea is to explore an underground cave "
"with many rooms and to collect the treasures you find there. If you type "
"xyzzy at the appropriate time, you can move instantly between two "
"otherwise distant points. If, therefore, you encounter some bit of "
":ref:`magic`\\, you might remark on this quite succinctly by saying "
"simply \"Xyzzy!\" \"Ordinarily you can't look at someone else's screen if"
" he has protected it, but if you type quadruple-bucky-clear the system "
"will let you do it anyway.\" \"Xyzzy!\" It's traditional for xyzzy to be "
"an :ref:`Easter-egg` in games with text interfaces."

"Xyzzy has actually been implemented as an undocumented no-op command on "
"several OSes; in Data General's AOS/VS, for example, it would typically "
"respond \"Nothing happens\", just as :ref:`ADVENT` did if the magic was "
"invoked at the wrong spot or before a player had performed the action "
"that enabled the word. In more recent 32-bit versions, by the way, AOS/VS"
" responds \"Twice as much happens\"."

"Early versions of the popular ‘minesweeper’ game under Microsoft Windows "
"had a cheat mode triggered by the command ‘xyzzy<enter><right-shift>’ "
"that turns the top-left pixel of the screen different colors depending on"
" whether or not the cursor is over a bomb. This feature temporarily "
"disappeared in Windows 98, but reappeared in Windows 2000."

"The following passage from *The Wonderful Wizard of Oz* by L. Frank Baum,"
" suggesting a possible pre-ADVENT origin, has recently come to light: "
"\"Ziz-zy, zuz-zy, zik!\" said Dorothy, who was now standing on both feet."
" This ended the saying of the charm, and they heard a great chattering "
"and flapping of wings, as the band of Winged Monkeys flew up to them."
