"Omnivorous, but usually includes lots of science and science fiction. The"
" typical hacker household might subscribe to *Analog*\\, *Scientific "
"American*\\, *Whole-EarthReview*\\, and *Smithsonian* (most hackers "
"ignore *Wired* and other self-consciously ‘cyberpunk’ magazines, "
"considering them :ref:`wannabee` fodder). Hackers often have a reading "
"range that astonishes liberal arts people but tend not to talk about it "
"as much. Many hackers spend as much of their spare time reading as the "
"average American burns up watching TV, and often keep shelves and shelves"
" of well-thumbed books in their homes."
