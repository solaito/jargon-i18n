"Most hackers don't smoke tobacco, and use alcohol in moderation if at "
"all. However, there has been something of a trend towards exotic beers "
"since about 1995, especially among younger Linux hackers apparently "
"influenced by Linus Torvalds's fondness for Guinness."

"Limited use of non-addictive psychedelic drugs, such as cannabis, LSD, "
"psilocybin, nitrous oxide, etc., used to be relatively common and is "
"still regarded with more tolerance than in the mainstream culture. Use of"
" ‘downers’ and opiates, on the other hand, appears to be particularly "
"rare; hackers seem in general to dislike drugs that make them stupid. But"
" :ref:`on-the-gripping-hand`\\, many hackers regularly wire up on "
"caffeine and/or sugar for all-night hacking runs."
