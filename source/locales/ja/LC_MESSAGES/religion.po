"Agnostic. Atheist. Non-observant Jewish. Neo-pagan. Very commonly, three "

"Even hackers who identify with a religious affiliation tend to be relaxed"
" about it, hostile to organized religion in general and all forms of "
"religious bigotry in particular. Many enjoy ‘parody’ religions such as "
"Discordianism and the Church of the SubGenius."

"(less commonly) Taoism, and blend them easily with their ‘native’ "
"religions."

"There is a definite strain of mystical, almost Gnostic sensibility that "
"shows up even among those hackers not actively involved with neo-"
"paganism, Discordianism, or Zen. Hacker folklore that pays homage to "

"psychological truthfulness about it to be entirely a joke."
