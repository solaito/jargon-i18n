"These are some of the funniest examples of a genre of jokes told at the "
"MIT AI Lab about various noted hackers. The original koans were composed "
"by Danny Hillis, who would later found Connection Machines, Inc. In "
"reading these, it is at least useful to know that Minsky, Sussman, and "
"Drescher are AI researchers of note, that Tom Knight was one of the Lisp "
"machine's principal designers, and that David Moon wrote much of Lisp "
"Machine Lisp."
