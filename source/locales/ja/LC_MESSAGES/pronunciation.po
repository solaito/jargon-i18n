"Pronunciation keys are provided in the jargon listings for all entries "

"Syllables are hyphen-separated, except that an accent or back-accent "
"follows each accented syllable (the back-accent marks a secondary accent "
"in some words of four or more syllables). If no accent is given, the word"
" is pronounced with equal accentuation on all syllables (this is common "
"for abbreviations)."

"Consonants are pronounced as in American English. The letter ‘g’ is "
"always hard (as in \"got\" rather than \"giant\"); ‘ch’ is soft "
"(\"church\" rather than \"chemist\"). The letter ‘j’ is the sound that "
"occurs twice in \"judge\". The letter ‘s’ is always as in \"pass\", never"
" a z sound. The digraph ‘kh’ is the guttural of \"loch\" or \"l'chaim\". "
"The digraph ‘gh’ is the aspirated g+h of \"bughouse\" or \"ragheap\" "
"(rare in English)."

"Note that the above table reflects mainly distinctions found in standard "
"American English (that is, the neutral dialect spoken by TV network "
"announcers and typical of educated speech in the Upper Midwest, Chicago, "
"Minneapolis/St. Paul and Philadelphia). However, we separate /o/ from "
"/ah/, which tend to merge in standard American. This may help readers "
"accustomed to accents resembling British Received Pronunciation."

"The intent of this scheme is to permit as many readers as possible to map"
" the pronunciations into their local dialect by ignoring some subset of "
"the distinctions we make. Speakers of British RP, for example, can smash "
"terminal /r/ and all unstressed vowels. Speakers of many varieties of "
"southern American will automatically map /o/ to /aw/; and so forth. "
"(Standard American makes a good reference dialect for this purpose "
"because it has crisp consonants and more vowel distinctions than other "
"major dialects, and tends to retain distinctions between unstressed "
"vowels. It also happens to be what your editor speaks.)"
