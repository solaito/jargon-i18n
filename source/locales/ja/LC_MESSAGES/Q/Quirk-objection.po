"[Named for Captain Gym Z. Quirk, the first to raise it.] \"Objection! "
"Assumes organ not in evidence!\" Used in :samp:`news.admin.net-"
"abuse.email` to point out that a comment assumes the presence of "
"something whose existence has not been proven, such as a spammer's brain "
"or gonads. This is not used to refer to things that are definitely proven"
" *not* to exist, such as a spammer's ethics. It's applicable to enough "
"postings there that a poster wishing to raise the objection often need "
"merely say \"ObQuirk! \", an instance of the :ref:`Ob-` convention."
