"A theory that characterizes the universe in terms of bogon sources (such "
"as politicians, used-car salesmen, TV evangelists, and :ref:`suit`\\s in "
"general), bogon sinks (such as taxpayers and computers), and bogosity "
"potential fields. Bogon absorption, of course, causes human beings to "
"behave mindlessly and machines to fail (and may also cause both to emit "
"secondary bogons); however, the precise mechanics of the bogon-computron "
"interaction are not yet understood and remain to be elucidated. Quantum "
"bogodynamics is most often invoked to explain the sharp increase in "
"hardware and software failures in the presence of suits; the latter emit "
"bogons, which the former absorb. See :ref:`bogon`\\, :ref:`computron`\\, "
":ref:`suit`\\, :ref:`psyton`\\."

"Here is a representative QBD theory: The bogon is a boson (integral spin,"
" +1 or -1), and has zero rest mass. In this respect it is very much like "
"a photon. However, it has a much greater momentum, thus explaining its "
"destructive effect on computer electronics and human nervous systems. The"
" corollary to this is that bogons also have tremendous inertia, and "
"therefore a bogon beam is deflected only with great difficulty. When the "
"bogon encounters its antiparticle, the cluon, they mutually annihilate "
"each other, releasing magic smoke. Furthermore 1 Lenat = 1 mole "
"(6.022E23) of bogons (see :ref:`microLenat`\\)."
