"In techspeak and jargon, the standard metric prefixes used in the SI "
"(Système International) conventions for scientific measurement have dual "
"uses. With units of time or things that come in powers of 10, such as "
"money, they retain their usual meanings of multiplication by powers of "
"``1000 = 10^3``\\. But when used with bytes or other things that "
"naturally come in powers of 2, they usually denote multiplication by "
"powers of ``1024 = 2^10``\\."

"The prefixes zetta-, yotta-, zepto-, and yocto- have been included in "
"these tables purely for completeness and giggle value; they were adopted "
"in 1990 by the *19th Conference Generale des Poids et Mesures*\\. The "
"binary peta- and exa- loadings, though well established, are not in "
"jargon use either — yet. The prefix milli-, denoting multiplication by "
"``1/1000``\\, has always been rare in jargon (there is, however, a "
"standard joke about the millihelen — notionally, the amount of beauty "
"required to launch one ship). See the entries on :ref:`micro-`\\, "
":ref:`pico-`\\, and :ref:`nano-` for more information on connotative "
"jargon use of these terms. ‘Femto’ and ‘atto’ (which, interestingly, "
"derive not from Greek but from Danish) have not yet acquired jargon "
"loadings, though it is easy to predict what those will be once computing "
"technology enters the required realms of magnitude (however, see "
":ref:`attoparsec`\\)."

"There are, of course, some standard unit prefixes for powers of 10. In "
"the following table, the ‘prefix’ column is the international standard "
"prefix for the appropriate power of ten; the ‘binary’ column lists jargon"
" abbreviations and words for the corresponding power of 2. The B-suffixed"
" forms are commonly used for byte quantities; the words ‘meg’ and ‘gig’ "
"are nouns that may (but do not always) pluralize with ‘s’."

"Confusingly, hackers often use K or M as though they were suffix or "
"numeric multipliers rather than a prefix; thus \"2K dollars\", \"2M of "
"disk space\". This is also true (though less commonly) of G."

"Note that the formal SI metric prefix for 1000 is ‘k’; some use this "
"strictly, reserving ‘K’ for multiplication by 1024 (KB is thus "
"‘kilobytes’)."

"K, M, and G used alone refer to quantities of bytes; thus, 64G is 64 "
"gigabytes and ‘a K’ is a kilobyte (compare mainstream use of ‘a G’ as "
"short for ‘a grand’, that is, $1000). Whether one pronounces ‘gig’ with "
"hard or soft ‘g’ depends on what one thinks the proper pronunciation of "
"‘giga-’ is."

"Confusing 1000 and 1024 (or other powers of 2 and 10 close in magnitude) "
"— for example, describing a memory in units of 500K or 524K instead of "
"512K — is a sure sign of the :ref:`marketroid`\\. One example of this: it"
" is common to refer to the capacity of 3.5\" floppies as ‘1.44 MB’ In "
"fact, this is a completely :ref:`bogus` number. The correct size is 1440 "
"KB, that is, 1440 \\* 1024 = 1474560 bytes. So the ‘mega’ in ‘1.44 MB’ is"
" compounded of two ‘kilos’, one of which is 1024 and the other of which "
"is 1000. The correct number of megabytes would of course be 1440 / 1024 ="
" 1.40625. Alas, this fine point is probably lost on the world forever. "
"[1993 update: hacker Morgan Burke has proposed, to general approval on "
"Usenet, the following additional prefixes:"
