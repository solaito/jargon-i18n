"Historical note: The QWERTY layout is a fine example of a "
":ref:`fossil`\\. It is sometimes said that it was designed to slow down "
"the typist, but this is wrong; it was designed to allow *faster* typing —"
" under a constraint now long obsolete. In early typewriters, fast typing "
"using nearby type-bars jammed the mechanism. So Sholes fiddled the layout"
" to separate the letters of many common digraphs (he did a far from "
"perfect job, though; ‘th’, ‘tr’, ‘ed’, and ‘er’, for example, each use "
"two nearby keys). Also, putting the letters of ‘typewriter’ on one line "
"allowed it to be typed with particular speed and accuracy for "
":ref:`demo`\\s. The jamming problem was essentially solved soon afterward"
" by a suitable use of springs, but the keyboard layout lives on."
