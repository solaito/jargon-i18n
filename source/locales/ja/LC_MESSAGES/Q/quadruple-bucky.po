"On a Stanford or MIT keyboard in :ref:`raw-mode`\\, use of four shift "
"keys while typing a fifth character, where the four shift keys are the "
"control and meta keys on *both* sides of the keyboard. This was very "
"difficult to do! One accepted technique was to press the left-control and"
" left-meta keys with your left hand, the right-control and right-meta "
"keys with your right hand, and the fifth key with your nose."

"Quadruple-bucky combinations were very seldom used in practice, because "
"when one invented a new command one usually assigned it to some character"
" that was easier to type. If you want to imply that a program has "
"ridiculously many commands or features, you can say something like: \"Oh,"
" the command that makes it spin the tapes while whistling Beethoven's "
"Fifth Symphony is quadruple-bucky-cokebottle.\" See :ref:`double-"
"bucky`\\, :ref:`bucky-bits`\\, :ref:`cokebottle`\\."
