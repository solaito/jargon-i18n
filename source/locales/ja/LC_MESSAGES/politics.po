"Formerly vaguely liberal-moderate, more recently moderate-to-"
"neoconservative (hackers too were affected by the collapse of socialism)."
" There is a strong libertarian contingent which rejects conventional "
"left-right politics entirely. The only safe generalization is that "
"hackers tend to be rather anti-authoritarian; thus, both "
"paleoconservatism and ‘hard’ leftism are rare. Hackers are far more "
"likely than most non-hackers to either (a) be aggressively apolitical or "
"(b) entertain peculiar or idiosyncratic political ideas and actually try "
"to live by them day-to-day."
