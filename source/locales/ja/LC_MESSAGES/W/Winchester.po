"Informal generic term for sealed-enclosure magnetic-disk drives in which "
"the read-write head planes over the disk surface on an air cushion. There"
" is a legend that the name arose because the original 1973 engineering "
"prototype for what later became the IBM 3340 featured two 30-megabyte "
"volumes; 30--30 became ‘Winchester’ when somebody noticed the similarity "
"to the common term for a famous Winchester rifle (in the latter, the "
"first 30 referred to caliber and the second to the grain weight of the "
"charge). (It is sometimes incorrectly claimed that Winchester was the "
"laboratory in which the technology was developed.)"
