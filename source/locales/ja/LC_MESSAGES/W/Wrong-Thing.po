"A design, action, or decision that is clearly incorrect or inappropriate."
" Often capitalized; always emphasized in speech as if capitalized. The "
"opposite of the :ref:`Right-Thing`\\; more generally, anything that is "
"not the Right Thing. In cases where ‘the good is the enemy of the best’, "
"the merely good — although good — is nevertheless the Wrong Thing. \"In "
"C, the default is for module-level declarations to be visible everywhere,"
" rather than just within the module. This is clearly the Wrong Thing.\""
