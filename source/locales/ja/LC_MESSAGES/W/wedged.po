"To be stuck, incapable of proceeding without help. This is different from"
" having crashed. If the system has crashed, it has become totally non-"
"functioning. If the system is wedged, it is trying to do something but "
"cannot make progress; it may be capable of doing a few things, but not be"
" fully operational. For example, a process may become wedged if it "
":ref:`deadlock`\\s with another (but not all instances of wedging are "
"deadlocks). See also :ref:`gronk`\\, :ref:`locked-up`\\, :ref:`hosed`\\, "
":ref:`hung` (wedged is more severe than :ref:`hung`\\)."

"There is some dispute over the origin of this term. It is usually thought"
" to derive from a common description of recto-cranial inversion; however,"
" it may actually have originated with older ‘hot-press’ printing "
"technology in which physical type elements were locked into type frames "
"with wedges driven in by mallets. Once this had been done, no changes in "
"the typesetting for that page could be made."
