"[scientific computation] In solving partial differential equations by "
"finite difference and similar methods, wiggles are sawtooth (up-down-up-"
"down) oscillations at the shortest wavelength representable on the grid. "
"If an algorithm is unstable, this is often the most unstable waveform, so"
" it grows to dominate the solution. Alternatively, stable (though "
"inaccurate) wiggles can be generated near a discontinuity by a Gibbs "
"phenomenon."
