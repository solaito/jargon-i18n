"A form of game cheat especially associated with first-person shooters "
"like Quake, in which the walls in the simulated maze or dungeon are "
"rendered transparent to the cheater. This gives the cheater normally "
"hidden information about the whereabouts of other players. Beyond gaming,"
" a wallhack is the paradigm case of a whole class of security problems "
"that stem from the fact that a server cannot trust client software, and "
"server authors must assume that all computation farmed out to a client is"
" exposed to and can be interfered with by the user."
