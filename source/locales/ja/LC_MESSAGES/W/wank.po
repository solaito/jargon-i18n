"[Columbia University: prob. : by mutation from Commonwealth slang v. "
"wank, to masturbate] Used much as :ref:`hack` is elsewhere, as a noun "
"denoting a clever technique or person or the result of such cleverness. "
"May describe (negatively) the act of hacking for hacking's sake (\"Quit "
"wanking, let's go get supper!\") or (more positively) a :ref:`wizard`\\. "
"Adj. wanky describes something particularly clever (a person, program, or"
" algorithm). Conversations can also get wanky when there are too many "
"wanks involved. This excess wankiness is signalled by an overload of the "
"wankometer (compare :ref:`bogometer`\\). When the wankometer overloads, "
"the conversation's subject must be changed, or all non-wanks will leave. "
"Compare neep-neeping (under :ref:`neep-neep`\\). Usage: U.S. only. In "
"Britain and the Commonwealth this word is *extremely* rude and is best "
"avoided unless one intends to give offense. Adjectival wanky is less "
"offensive and simply means ‘stupid’ or ‘broken’ (this is mainstream in "
"Great Britain)."
