"The obvious antonym to read-only memory. Out of frustration with the long"
" and seemingly useless chain of approvals required of component "
"specifications, during which no actual checking seemed to occur, an "
"engineer at Signetics once created a specification for a write-only "
"memory and included it with a bunch of other specifications to be "
"approved. This inclusion came to the attention of Signetics "
":ref:`management` only when regular customers started calling and asking "
"for pricing information. Signetics published a corrected edition of the "
"data book and requested the return of the ‘erroneous’ ones. Later, in "
"1972, Signetics bought a double-page spread in *Electronics* magazine's "
"April issue and used the spec as an April Fools' Day joke. Instead of the"
" more conventional characteristic curves, the 25120 \"fully encoded, 9046"
" x N, Random Access, write-only-memory\" data sheet included diagrams of "
"\"bit capacity vs.: Temp. \", \"Iff vs. Vff\", \"Number of pins remaining"
" vs.: number of socket insertions\", and \"AQL vs.: selling price\". The "
"25120 required a 6.3 VAC VFF supply, a +10V VCC, and VDD of 0V, "
"``±2%``\\."
