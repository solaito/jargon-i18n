"A person or algorithm that compensates for lack of sophistication or "
"native stupidity by efficiently following some simple procedure shown to "
"have been effective in the past. Used of an algorithm, this is not "
"necessarily pejorative; it recalls ‘Harvey Wallbanger’, the winning robot"
" in an early AI contest (named, of course, after the cocktail). Harvey "
"successfully solved mazes by keeping a ‘finger’ on one wall and running "
"till it came out the other end. This was inelegant, but it was "
"mathematically guaranteed to work on simply-connected mazes — and, in "
"fact, Harvey outperformed more sophisticated robots that tried to ‘learn’"
" each maze by building an internal representation of it. Used of humans, "
"the term *is* pejorative and implies an uncreative, bureaucratic, by-the-"
"book mentality. See also :ref:`code-grinder`\\; compare :ref:`droid`\\."
