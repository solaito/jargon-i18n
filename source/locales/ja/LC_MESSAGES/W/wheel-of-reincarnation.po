"[coined in a paper by T.H. Myer and I.E. Sutherland *On the Design of "
"Display Processors*\\, Comm. ACM, Vol. 11, no. 6, June 1968)] Term used "
"to refer to a well-known effect whereby function in a computing system "
"family is migrated out to special-purpose peripheral hardware for speed, "
"then the peripheral evolves toward more computing power as it does its "
"job, then somebody notices that it is inefficient to support two "
"asymmetrical processors in the architecture and folds the function back "
"into the main CPU, at which point the cycle begins again."
