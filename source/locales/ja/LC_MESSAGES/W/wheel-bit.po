"A privilege bit that allows the possessor to perform some restricted "
"operation on a timesharing system, such as read or write any file on the "
"system regardless of protections, change or look at any address in the "
"running monitor, crash or reload the system, and kill or create jobs and "
"user accounts. The term was invented on the TENEX operating system, and "
"carried over to TOPS-20, XEROX-IFS, and others. The state of being in a "
"privileged logon is sometimes called wheel mode. This term entered the "
"Unix culture from TWENEX in the mid-1980s and has been gaining popularity"
" there (esp. at university sites). See also :ref:`root`\\."
