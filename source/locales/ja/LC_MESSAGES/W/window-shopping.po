"[US Geological Survey] Among users of :ref:`WIMP-environment`\\s like "
":ref:`X` or the Macintosh, extended experimentation with new window "
"colors, fonts, and icon shapes. This activity can take up hours of what "
"might otherwise have been productive working time. \"I spent the "
"afternoon window shopping until I found the coolest shade of green for my"
" active window borders â€” now they perfectly match my medium slate blue "
"background.\" Serious window shoppers will spend their days with bitmap "
"editors, creating new and different icons and background patterns for all"
" to see. Also: window dressing, the act of applying new fonts, colors, "
"etc. See :ref:`fritterware`\\, compare :ref:`macdink`\\."
