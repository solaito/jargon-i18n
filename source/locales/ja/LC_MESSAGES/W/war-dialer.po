"[originally from ‘wargames dialer’, a reference to the movie *War "
"Games*\\] A cracking tool, a program that calls a given list or range of "
"phone numbers and records those which answer with handshake tones (and so"
" might be entry points to computer or telecommunications systems). Some "
"of these programs have become quite sophisticated, and can now detect "
"modem, fax, or PBX tones and log each one separately. The war dialer is "
"one of the most important tools in the :ref:`phreaker`\\'s kit. These "
"programs evolved from early :ref:`demon-dialer`\\s."
