"[n.,obs.] A location in a monitor which contains the address of a "
"routine, with the specific intent of making it easy to substitute a "
"different routine. This term is now obsolescent; modern operating systems"
" use clusters of wormholes extensively (for modularization of I/O "
"handling in particular, as in the Unix device-driver organization) but "
"the preferred techspeak for these clusters is ‘device tables’, ‘jump "
"tables’ or ‘capability tables’."

"[Amateur Packet Radio] A network path using a commercial satellite link "
"to join two or more amateur VHF networks. So called because traffic "
"routed through a wormhole leaves and re-enters the amateur network over "
"great distances with usually little clue in the message routing header as"
" to how it got from one relay to the other. Compare :ref:`gopher-hole` "
"(sense 2)."
