"[from the Lojban-language list] Software designs are often restricted in "
"unavoidable ways by the capacities of the operating system or hardware "
"they have to work with. Sometimes they are restricted in avoidable ways "
"by mental habits a developer has picked up from a particular language or "
"environment (perhaps a now-obsolete one) and never discarded. When a "
"design develops complications that are the result of a mental habit that "
"is no longer adaptive, the developer has succumbed to Whorfian mind-lock."
" The design itself has been ‘whorfed’."

"For example, some Unix designs are whorfed by the assumption that "
"directory searches are linear and expensive for large directories; "
"therefore directories must be kept small. Another common way to succumb "
"to Whorfian mind-lock is to do serial processing with a small working set"
" rather than slurping an entire file or data structure into memory; the "
"hidden assumption here is that not much core is available and virtual "
"memory works poorly if at all. Detecting Whorfian mind-lock is important,"
" because it tends to introduce unnecessary complexity and bugs."
