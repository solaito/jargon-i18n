"[Traced to Flip Wilson's \"Geraldine\" character c.1970] Describes a user"
" interface under which \"What You See Is What You Get\", as opposed to "
"one that uses more-or-less obscure commands that do not result in "
"immediate visual feedback. True WYSIWYG in environments supporting "
"multiple fonts or graphics is a rarely-attained ideal; there are variants"
" of this term to express real-world manifestations including WYSIAWYG "
"(What You See Is *Almost* What You Get) and WYSIMOLWYG (What You See Is "
"More or Less What You Get). All these can be mildly derogatory, as they "
"are often used to refer to dumbed-down :ref:`user-friendly` interfaces "
"targeted at non-programmers; a hacker has no fear of obscure commands "
"(compare :ref:`WYSIAYG`\\). On the other hand, :ref:`EMACS` was one of "
"the very first WYSIWYG editors, replacing (actually, at first overlaying)"
" the extremely obscure, command-based :ref:`TECO`\\. See also :ref:`WIMP-"
"environment`\\. [Oddly enough, WYSIWYG made it into the 1986 supplement "
"to the OED, in lower case yet. —ESR]"
