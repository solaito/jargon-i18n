"An occasional failure mode of magnetic-disk drives back in the days when "
"they were huge, clunky :ref:`washing-machine`\\s. Those old "
":ref:`dinosaur` parts carried terrific angular momentum; the combination "
"of a misaligned spindle or worn bearings and stick-slip interactions with"
" the floor could cause them to ‘walk’ across a room, lurching alternate "
"corners forward a couple of millimeters at a time. There is a legend "
"about a drive that walked over to the only door to the computer room and "
"jammed it shut; the staff had to cut a hole in the wall in order to get "
"at it! Walking could also be induced by certain patterns of drive access "
"(a fast seek across the whole width of the disk, followed by a slow seek "
"in the other direction). Some bands of old-time hackers figured out how "
"to induce disk-accessing patterns that would do this to particular drive "
"models and held disk-drive races."
