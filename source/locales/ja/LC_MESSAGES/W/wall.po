"It is said that sense 1 came from the idiom ‘like talking to a blank "
"wall’. It was originally used in situations where, after you had "
"carefully answered a question, the questioner stared at you blankly, "
"clearly having understood nothing that was explained. You would then "
"throw out a \"Hello, wall?\" to elicit some sort of response from the "
"questioner. Later, confused questioners began voicing \"Wall?\" "
"themselves."
