"[on BBSes] Any of a species of luser resembling a less amusing version of"
" :ref:`B1FF` that infests many :ref:`BBS` systems. The typical weenie is "
"a teenage boy with poor social skills travelling under a grandiose "
":ref:`handle` derived from fantasy or heavy-metal rock lyrics. Among "
"sysops, the weenie problem refers to the marginally literate and "
"profanity-laden :ref:`flamage` weenies tend to spew all over a newly-"
"discovered BBS. Compare :ref:`spod`\\, :ref:`geek`\\, :ref:`terminal-"

"[among hackers] When used with a qualifier (for example, as in :ref"
":`Unix-weenie`\\, VMS weenie, IBM weenie) this can be either an insult or"
" a term of praise, depending on context, tone of voice, and whether or "
"not it is applied by a person who considers him or herself to be the same"
" sort of weenie. Implies that the weenie has put a major investment of "
"time, effort, and concentration into the area indicated; whether this is "
"good or bad depends on the hearer's judgment of how the speaker feels "
"about that area. See also :ref:`bigot`\\."
