"(also, more plausibly, spelled wannabe) [from a term recently used to "
"describe Madonna fans who dress, talk, and act like their idol; prob. : "
"originally from biker slang] A would-be :ref:`hacker`\\. The connotations"
" of this term differ sharply depending on the age and exposure of the "
"subject. Used of a person who is in or might be entering :ref:`larval-"
"stage`\\, it is semi-approving; such wannabees can be annoying but most "
"hackers remember that they, too, were once such creatures. When used of "
"any professional programmer, CS academic, writer, or :ref:`suit`\\, it is"
" derogatory, implying that said person is trying to cuddle up to the "
"hacker mystique but doesn't, fundamentally, have a prayer of "
"understanding what it is all about. Overuse of terms from this lexicon is"
" often an indication of the :ref:`wannabee` nature. Compare "
":ref:`newbie`\\."

"Historical note: The wannabee phenomenon has a slightly different flavor "
"now (1993) than it did ten or fifteen years ago. When the people who are "
"now hackerdom's tribal elders were in :ref:`larval-stage`\\, the process "
"of becoming a hacker was largely unconscious and unaffected by models "
"known in popular culture — communities formed spontaneously around people"
" who, *as individuals*\\, felt irresistibly drawn to do hackerly things, "
"and what wannabees experienced was a fairly pure, skill-focused desire to"
" become similarly wizardly. Those days of innocence are gone forever; "
"society's adaptation to the advent of the microcomputer after 1980 "
"included the elevation of the hacker as a new kind of folk hero, and the "
"result is that some people semi-consciously set out to *be hackers* and "
"borrow hackish prestige by fitting the popular image of hackers. "
"Fortunately, to do this really well, one has to actually become a wizard."
" Nevertheless, old-time hackers tend to share a poorly articulated "
"disquiet about the change; among other things, it gives them mixed "
"feelings about the effects of public compendia of lore like this one."
