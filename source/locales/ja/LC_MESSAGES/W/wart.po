"A small, :ref:`crock`\\y :ref:`feature` that sticks out of an otherwise "
":ref:`clean` design. Something conspicuous for localized ugliness, "
"especially a special-case exception to a general rule. For example, in "
"some versions of :manpage:`csh(1)`\\, single quotes literalize every "
"character inside them except ``!``\\. In ANSI C, the ``? ?`` syntax used "
"for obtaining ASCII characters in a foreign environment is a wart. See "
"also :ref:`miswart`\\."
