"A small power-supply brick with integral male plug, designed to plug "
"directly into a wall outlet; called a ‘wart’ because when installed on a "
"power strip it tends to block up at least one more socket than it uses. "
"These are frequently associated with modems and other small electronic "
"devices which would become unacceptably bulky or hot if they had power "
"supplies on board (there are other reasons as well having to do with the "
"cost of UL certification)."
