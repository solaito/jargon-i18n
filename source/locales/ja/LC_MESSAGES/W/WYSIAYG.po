"Describes a user interface under which \"What You See Is All You Get\"; "
"an unhappy variant of :ref:`WYSIWYG`\\. Visual, ‘point-and-shoot’-style "
"interfaces tend to have easy initial learning curves, but also to lack "
"depth; they often frustrate advanced users who would be better served by "
"a command-style interface. When this happens, the frustrated user has a "
"WYSIAYG problem. This term is most often used of editors, word "
"processors, and document formatting programs. WYSIWYG ‘desktop "
"publishing’ programs, for example, are a clear win for creating small "
"documents with lots of fonts and graphics in them, especially things like"
" newsletters and presentation slides. When typesetting book-length "
"manuscripts, on the other hand, scale changes the nature of the task; one"
" quickly runs into WYSIAYG limitations, and the increased power and "
"flexibility of a command-driven formatter like :ref:`TeX` or Unix's "
":ref:`troff` becomes not just desirable but a necessity. Compare "
":ref:`YAFIYGI`\\."
