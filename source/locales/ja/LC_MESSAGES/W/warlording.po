"[from the Usenet group :samp:`alt.fan.warlord`\\] The act of excoriating "
"a bloated, ugly, or derivative :ref:`sig-block`\\. Common grounds for "
"warlording include the presence of a signature rendered in a "
":ref:`BUAF`\\, over-used or cliched :ref:`sig-quote`\\s, ugly :ref"
":`ASCII-art`\\, or simply excessive size. The original ‘Warlord’ was a "
":ref:`B1FF`\\-like :ref:`newbie` c.1991 who featured in his sig a "
"particularly large and obnoxious ASCII graphic resembling the sword of "
"Conan the Barbarian in the 1981 John Milius movie; the group name "
":samp:`alt.fan.warlord` was sarcasm, and the characteristic mode of "
"warlording is devastatingly sarcastic praise. See also :ref:`McQuary-"
