"[from tapeworm in John Brunner's novel *The Shockwave Rider*\\, via XEROX"
" PARC] A program that propagates itself over a network, reproducing "
"itself as it goes. Compare :ref:`virus`\\. Nowadays the term has negative"
" connotations, as it is assumed that only :ref:`cracker`\\s write worms. "
"Perhaps the best-known example was Robert T. Morris's :ref:`Great-Worm` "
"of 1988, a ‘benign’ one that got out of control and hogged hundreds of "
"Suns and VAXen across the U.S. See also :ref:`cracker`\\, :ref:`RTM`\\, "
":ref:`Trojan-horse`\\, :ref:`ice`\\."
