"A person, similar to a :ref:`hacker`\\, who enjoys exploring the details "
"of programmable systems and how to stretch their capabilities. Whereas a "
"hacker tends to produce great hacks, a whacker only ends up whacking the "
"system or program in question. Whackers are often quite egotistical and "
"eager to claim :ref:`wizard` status, regardless of the views of their "
"peers."
