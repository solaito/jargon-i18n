"The central monster (and, in many versions, the name) of a famous family "
"of very early computer games called *Hunt The Wumpus*\\. The original was"
" invented in 1970 (several years before :ref:`ADVENT`\\) by Gregory Yob. "
"The wumpus lived somewhere in a cave with the topology of an "
"dodecahedron's edge/vertex graph (later versions supported other "
"topologies, including an icosahedron and Möbius strip). The player "
"started somewhere at random in the cave with five ‘crooked arrows’; these"
" could be shot through up to three connected rooms, and would kill the "
"wumpus on a hit (later versions introduced the wounded wumpus, which got "
"very angry). Unfortunately for players, the movement necessary to map the"
" maze was made hazardous not merely by the wumpus (which would eat you if"
" you stepped on him) but also by bottomless pits and colonies of super "
"bats that would pick you up and drop you at a random location (later "
"versions added ‘anaerobic termites’ that ate arrows, bat migrations, and "
"earthquakes that randomly changed pit locations)."

"This game appears to have been the first to use a non-random graph-"
"structured map (as opposed to a rectangular grid like the even older Star"
" Trek games). In this respect, as in the dungeon-like setting and its "
"terse, amusing messages, it prefigured :ref:`ADVENT` and :ref:`Zork` and "
"was directly ancestral to the latter (Zork acknowledged this heritage by "
"including a super-bat colony). A C emulation of the original Basic game "
"is available at the Retrocomputing Museum, `http://www.catb.org/retro/ "
"<http://www.catb.org/retro/>`_."
