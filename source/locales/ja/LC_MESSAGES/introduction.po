msgid "Hacker Slang and Hacker Culture"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This document is a collection of slang terms used by various subcultures "
"of computer hackers. Though some technical material is included for "
"background and flavor, it is not a technical dictionary; what we describe"
" here is the language hackers use among themselves for fun, social "
"communication, and technical debate."

"The ‘hacker culture’ is actually a loosely networked collection of "
"subcultures that is nevertheless conscious of some important shared "
"experiences, shared roots, and shared values. It has its own myths, "
"heroes, villains, folk epics, in-jokes, taboos, and dreams. Because "
"hackers as a group are particularly creative people who define themselves"
" partly by rejection of ‘normal’ values and working habits, it has "
"unusually rich and conscious traditions for an intentional culture less "
"than 50 years old."

"As usual with slang, the special vocabulary of hackers helps hold places "
"in the community and expresses shared values and experiences. Also as "
"usual, *not* knowing the slang (or using it inappropriately) defines one "
"as an outsider, a mundane, or (worst of all in hackish vocabulary) "
"possibly even a :ref:`suit`\\. All human cultures use slang in this "
"threefold way — as a tool of communication, and of inclusion, and of "
"exclusion."

"Among hackers, though, slang has a subtler aspect, paralleled perhaps in "
"the slang of jazz musicians and some kinds of fine artists but hard to "
"detect in most technical or scientific cultures; parts of it are code for"
" shared states of *consciousness*\\. There is a whole range of altered "
"states and problem-solving mental stances basic to high-level hacking "
"which don't fit into conventional linguistic reality any better than a "
"Coltrane solo or one of Maurits Escher's surreal *trompel'oeil* "
"compositions (Escher is a favorite of hackers), and hacker slang encodes "
"these subtleties in many unobvious ways. As a simple example, take the "
"distinction between a :ref:`kluge` and an :ref:`elegant` solution, and "
"the differing connotations attached to each. The distinction is not only "
"of engineering significance; it reaches right back into the nature of the"
" generative processes in program design and asserts something important "
"about two different kinds of relationship between the hacker and the "
"hack. Hacker slang is unusually rich in implications of this kind, of "
"overtones and undertones that illuminate the hackish psyche."

"Hackers, as a rule, love wordplay and are very conscious and inventive in"
" their use of language. These traits seem to be common in young children,"
" but the conformity-enforcing machine we are pleased to call an "
"educational system bludgeons them out of most of us before adolescence. "
"Thus, linguistic invention in most subcultures of the modern West is a "
"halting and largely unconscious process. Hackers, by contrast, regard "
"slang formation and use as a game to be played for conscious pleasure. "
"Their inventions thus display an almost unique combination of the "
"neotenous enjoyment of language-play with the discrimination of educated "
"and powerful intelligence. Further, the electronic media which knit them "
"together are fluid, ‘hot’ connections, well adapted to both the "
"dissemination of new slang and the ruthless culling of weak and "
"superannuated specimens. The results of this process give us perhaps a "
"uniquely intense and accelerated view of linguistic evolution in action."

"Hacker slang also challenges some common linguistic and anthropological "
"assumptions. For example, in the early 1990s it became fashionable to "
"speak of ‘low-context’ versus ‘high-context’ communication, and to "
"classify cultures by the preferred context level of their languages and "
"art forms. It is usually claimed that low-context communication "
"(characterized by precision, clarity, and completeness of self-contained "
"utterances) is typical in cultures which value logic, objectivity, "
"individualism, and competition; by contrast, high-context communication "
"(elliptical, emotive, nuance-filled, multi-modal, heavily coded) is "
"associated with cultures which value subjectivity, consensus, "
"cooperation, and tradition. What then are we to make of hackerdom, which "
"is themed around extremely low-context interaction with computers and "
"exhibits primarily \"low-context\" values, but cultivates an almost "
"absurdly high-context slang style?"

"The intensity and consciousness of hackish invention make a compilation "
"of hacker slang a particularly effective window into the surrounding "
"culture — and, in fact, this one is the latest version of an evolving "
"compilation called the ‘Jargon File’, maintained by hackers themselves "
"since the early 1970s. This one (like its ancestors) is primarily a "
"lexicon, but also includes topic entries which collect background or "
"sidelight information on hacker culture that would be awkward to try to "
"subsume under individual slang definitions."

"Though the format is that of a reference volume, it is intended that the "
"material be enjoyable to browse. Even a complete outsider should find at "
"least a chuckle on nearly every page, and much that is amusingly thought-"
"provoking. But it is also true that hackers use humorous wordplay to make"
" strong, sometimes combative statements about what they feel. Some of "
"these entries reflect the views of opposing sides in disputes that have "
"been genuinely passionate; this is deliberate. We have not tried to "
"moderate or pretty up these disputes; rather we have attempted to ensure "
"that *everyone's* sacred cows get gored, impartially. Compromise is not "
"particularly a hackish virtue, but the honest presentation of divergent "
"viewpoints is."

"The reader with minimal computer background who finds some references "
"incomprehensibly technical can safely ignore them. We have not felt it "
"either necessary or desirable to eliminate all such; they, too, "
"contribute flavor, and one of this document's major intended audiences — "
"fledgling hackers already partway inside the culture — will benefit from "
"them."

"A selection of longer items of hacker folklore and humor is included in "
":ref:`Appendix A<appendixa>`\\. The ‘outside’ reader's attention is "
"particularly directed to the Portrait of J. Random Hacker in "
":ref:`Appendix B<appendixb>`\\. The :ref:`Bibliography<bibliography>`\\, "
"lists some non-technical works which have either influenced or described "
"the hacker culture."

"Because hackerdom is an intentional culture (one each individual must "
"choose by action to join), one should not be surprised that the line "
"between description and influence can become more than a little blurred. "
"Earlier versions of the Jargon File have played a central role in "
"spreading hacker language and the culture that goes with it to "
"successively larger populations, and we hope and expect that this one "
"will do likewise."
