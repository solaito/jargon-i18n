"Some hobbies are widely shared and recognized as going with the culture: "
"science fiction, music, medievalism (in the active form practiced by the "
"Society for Creative Anachronism and similar organizations), chess, go, "
"backgammon, wargames, and intellectual games of all kinds. (Role-playing "
"games such as Dungeons and Dragons used to be extremely popular among "
"hackers but they lost a bit of their luster as they moved into the "
"mainstream and became heavily commercialized. More recently, *Magic: "
"TheGathering* has been widely popular among hackers.) Logic puzzles. Ham "
"radio. Other interests that seem to correlate less strongly but "
"positively with hackerdom include linguistics and theater teching."
