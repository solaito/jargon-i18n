"Sense 1 may require some explanation. Most computer languages provide a "
"kind of data called integer, but such computer integers are usually very "
"limited in size; usually they must be smaller than :math:`2^{31}` "
"(2,147,483,648). If you want to work with numbers larger than that, you "
"have to use floating-point numbers, which are usually accurate to only "
"six or seven decimal places. Computer languages that provide bignums can "
"perform exact calculations on very large numbers, such as 1000! (the "
"factorial of 1000, which is 1000 times 999 times 998 times ... times 2 "
"times 1). For example, this value for 1000! was computed by the MacLISP "
"system using bignums:"
