msgid ""
"An :ref:`IRC` or :ref:`MUD` user who is actually a program. On IRC, "
"typically the robot provides some useful service. Examples are NickServ, "
"which tries to prevent random users from adopting :ref:`nick`\\s already "
"claimed by others, and MsgServ, which allows one to send asynchronous "
"messages to be delivered when the recipient signs on. Also common are "
"‘annoybots’, such as KissServ, which perform no useful function except to"
" send cute messages to other people. Service bots are less common on "
"MUDs; but some others, such as the ‘Julia’ bot active in 1990--91, have "
"been remarkably impressive Turing-test experiments, able to pass as human"
" for as long as ten or fifteen minutes of conversation."

"Note that bots in all senses were ‘robots’ when the terms first appeared "
"in the early 1990s, but the shortened form is now habitual."
