"An integer number representing the number of items hanging from a "
":ref:`batbelt`\\. In most settings, a Batman factor of more than 3 is not"
" acceptable without odd stares and whispering. This encourages the hacker"
" in question to choose items for the batbelt carefully to avoid awkward "
"social situations, usually amongst non-hackers."

"A somewhat more vaguely defined index of contribution to sense 1. Devices"
" that are especially obtrusive, such as large, older model cell phones, "
"\"Pocket\" PC devices and walkie talkies are said to have a high batman "
"factor. Sleeker devices such as a later-model Palm or StarTac phone are "
"prized for their low batman factor and lessened obtrusiveness and weight."
