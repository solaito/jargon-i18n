"See :ref:`brute-force-and-ignorance`\\. Also encountered in the variants "
"BFMI, \"brute force and massive ignorance\" and BFBI \"brute force and "
"bloody ignorance\". In some parts of the U.S. this abbreviation was "
"probably reinforced by a company called Browning-Ferris Industries in the"
" waste-management business; a large BFI logo in white-on-blue could be "
"seen on the sides of garbage trucks."
