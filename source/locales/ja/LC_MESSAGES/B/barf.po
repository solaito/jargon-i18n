"suitable error message, perhaps not. Examples: \"The division operation "
"barfs if you try to divide by 0.\" (That is, the division operation "

"causes the operation to fail in some unspecified, but generally obvious, "
"manner.) \"The text editor barfs if you try to read in a new file before "
"writing out the old one.\""
