"In the process of implementing a new computer language, the point at "
"which the language is sufficiently effective that one can implement the "
"language in itself. That is, for a new language called, hypothetically, "
"FOOGOL, one has reached break-even when one can write a demonstration "
"compiler for FOOGOL in FOOGOL, discard the original implementation "
"language, and thereafter use working versions of FOOGOL to develop newer "
"ones. This is an important milestone; see :ref:`MFTL`\\."

"Since this entry was first written, several correspondents have reported "
"that there actually was a compiler for a tiny Algol-like language called "
"Foogol floating around on various :ref:`VAXen` in the early and mid-"
"1980s. A FOOGOL implementation is available at the Retrocomputing Museum "
