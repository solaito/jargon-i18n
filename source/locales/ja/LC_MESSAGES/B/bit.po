"More generally, a (possibly incorrect) mental state of belief. \"I have a"

"(Meaning \"I think you were the last guy to hack on EMACS, and what I am "

"true.\") \"I just need one bit from you\" is a polite way of indicating "
"that you intend only a short interruption for a question that can "
"presumably be answered yes or no."

"A bit is said to be set if its value is true or 1, and reset or clear if "
"its value is false or 0. One speaks of setting and clearing bits. To "
":ref:`toggle` or invert a bit is to change it, either from 0 to 1 or from"
" 1 to 0. See also :ref:`flag`\\, :ref:`trit`\\, :ref:`mode-bit`\\."

"The term bit first appeared in print in the computer-science sense in a "
"1948 paper by information theorist Claude Shannon, and was there credited"
" to the early computer scientist John Tukey (who also seems to have "
"coined the term software). Tukey records that bit evolved over a lunch "
"table as a handier alternative to bigit or binit, at a conference in the "
"winter of 1943-44."
