"[Commodore users; perh. a deliberate phonetic mangling of boolean "
"variable?] Any variable that doesn't actually hold or control state, but "
"must nevertheless be declared, checked, or set. A typical balloonian "
"variable started out as a flag attached to some environment feature that "
"either became obsolete or was planned but never implemented. "
"Compatibility concerns (or politics attached to same) may require that "
"such a flag be treated as though it were :ref:`live`\\."
