"[orig. CMU, now very common] The degree to which something is "
":ref:`bogus`\\. Bogosity is measured with a :ref:`bogometer`\\; in a "
"seminar, when a speaker says something bogus, a listener might raise his "
"hand and say \"My bogometer just triggered\". More extremely, \"You just "
"pinned my bogometer\" means you just said or did something so "
"outrageously bogus that it is off the scale, pinning the bogometer needle"
" at the highest possible reading (one might also say \"You just redlined "
"my bogometer\"). The agreed-upon unit of bogosity is the "
":ref:`microLenat`\\."
