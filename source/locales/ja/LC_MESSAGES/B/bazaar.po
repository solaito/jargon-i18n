"In 1997, after meditating on the success of :ref:`Linux` for three years,"
" the Jargon File's own editor ESR wrote an analytical paper on hacker "
"culture and development models titled `The Cathedral and the Bazaar "
"<http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/>`_. The main "
"argument of the paper was that :ref:`Brookss-Law` is not the whole story;"
" given the right social machinery, debugging can be efficiently "
"parallelized across large numbers of programmers. The title metaphor "
"caught on (see also :ref:`cathedral`\\), and the style of development "
"typical in the Linux community is now often referred to as the bazaar "
"mode. Its characteristics include releasing code early and often, and "
"actively seeking the largest possible pool of peer reviewers. After 1998,"
" the evident success of this way of doing things became one of the "
"strongest arguments for :ref:`open-source`\\."
