"In a news or mail reply, to put the response to a news or email message "
"after the quoted content from the parent message. This is correct form, "
"and until around 2000 was so universal on the Internet that neither the "
"term ‘bottom-post’ nor its antonym :ref:`top-post` existed. Hackers "
"consider that the best practice is actually to excerpt only the relevent "
"portions of the parent message, then intersperse the poster's response in"
" such a way that each section of response appears directly after the "
"excerpt it applies to. This reduces message bulk, keeps thread content in"
" a logical order, and facilitates reading."
