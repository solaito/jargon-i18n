"The original loading of these terms was almost undoubtedly obscene, "
"possibly referring to a douche bag or the scrotum (we have reports of "
"\"Bite the douche bag!\" being used as a taunt at MIT 1970-1976, and we "
"have another report that \"Bite the bag!\" was in common use at least as "
"early as 1965), but in their current usage they have become almost "
"completely sanitized."
