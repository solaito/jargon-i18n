"[abbreviation for ‘Berkeley Software Distribution’] a family of "
":ref:`Unix` versions for the :ref:`DEC` :ref:`VAX` and :ref:`PDP-11` "
"developed by Bill Joy and others at :ref:`Berzerkeley` starting around "
"1977, incorporating paged virtual memory, TCP/IP networking enhancements,"
" and many other features. The BSD versions (4.1, 4.2, and 4.3) and the "
"commercial versions derived from them (SunOS, ULTRIX, and Mt. Xinu) held "
"the technical lead in the Unix world until AT&T's successful "
"standardization efforts after about 1986; descendants including "
"Free/Open/NetBSD, BSD/OS and MacOS X are still widely popular. Note that "
"BSD versions going back to 2.9 are often referred to by their version "
"numbers alone, without the BSD prefix. See also :ref:`Unix`\\."
