"Disgusting in design or function; esthetically unappealing. This word is "
"seldom used of people. \"This keyboard is bletcherous!\" (Perhaps the "
"keys don't work very well, or are misplaced.) See :ref:`losing`\\, "
":ref:`cretinous`\\, :ref:`bagbiting`\\, :ref:`bogus`\\, and "
":ref:`random`\\. The term :ref:`bletcherous` applies to the esthetics of "
"the thing so described; similarly for :ref:`cretinous`\\. By contrast, "
"something that is losing or bagbiting may be failing to meet objective "
"criteria. See also :ref:`bogus` and :ref:`random`\\, which have richer "
"and wider shades of meaning than any of the above."
