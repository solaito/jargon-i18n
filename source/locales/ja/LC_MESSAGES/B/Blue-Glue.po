"[IBM; obs.] IBM's SNA (Systems Network Architecture), an incredibly "
":ref:`losing` and :ref:`bletcherous` communications protocol once widely "
"favored at commercial shops that didn't know any better (like other "
"proprietary networking protocols, it became obsolete and effectively "
"disappeared after the Internet explosion c.1994). The official IBM "
"definition is \"that which binds blue boxes together.\" See :ref:`fear-"
"and-loathing`\\. It may not be irrelevant that Blue Glue is the trade "
"name of a 3M product that is commonly used to hold down the carpet "
"squares to the removable panel floors common in :ref:`dinosaur-pen`\\s. A"
" correspondent at U. Minn. reports that the CS department there has about"
" 80 bottles of the stuff hanging about, so they often refer to any messy "
"work to be done as using the blue glue."
