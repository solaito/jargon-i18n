":ref:`bar`\\. However, Pete Samson (compiler of the :ref:`TMRC` lexicon) "
"reports it was already current when he joined TMRC in 1958. He says \"It "
"came from *Pogo*\\. Albert the Alligator, when vexed or outraged, would "
"shout \"Bazz Fazz!\" or \"Rowrbazzle!\" The club layout was said to model"
" the (mythical) New England counties of Rowrfolk and Bassex (Rowrbazzle "
"mingled with (Norfolk/Suffolk/Middlesex/Essex).\""
