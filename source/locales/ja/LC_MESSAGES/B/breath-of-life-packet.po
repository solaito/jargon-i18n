"[XEROX PARC] An Ethernet packet that contains bootstrap (see "
":ref:`boot`\\) code, periodically sent out from a working computer to "
"infuse the ‘breath of life’ into any computer on the network that has "
"happened to crash. Machines depending on such packets have sufficient "
"hardware or firmware code to wait for (or request) such a packet during "
"the reboot process. See also :ref:`dickless-workstation`\\."

"The notional kiss-of-death packet, with a function complementary to that "
"of a breath-of-life packet, is recommended for dealing with hosts that "
"consume too many network resources. Though ‘kiss-of-death packet’ is "
"usually used in jest, there is at least one documented instance of an "
"Internet subnet with limited address-table slots in a gateway machine in "
"which such packets were routinely used to compete for slots, rather like "
"Christmas shoppers competing for scarce parking spaces."
