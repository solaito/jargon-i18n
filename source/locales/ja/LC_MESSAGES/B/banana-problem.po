"[from the story of the little girl who said \"I know how to spell "
"‘banana’, but I don't know when to stop\"]. Not knowing where or when to "
"bring a production to a close (compare :ref:`fencepost-error`\\). One may"
" say there is a banana problem of an algorithm with poorly defined or "
"incorrect termination conditions, or in discussing the evolution of a "
"design that may be succumbing to featuritis (see also :ref:`creeping-"
"elegance`\\, :ref:`creeping-featuritis`\\). See item 176 under "
":ref:`HAKMEM`\\, which describes a banana problem in a :ref:`Dissociated-"
"Press` implementation. Also, see :ref:`one-banana-problem` for a "
"superficially similar but unrelated usage."
