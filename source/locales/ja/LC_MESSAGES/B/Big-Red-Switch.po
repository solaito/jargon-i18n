"[IBM] The power switch on a computer, esp. the ‘Emergency Pull’ switch on"
" an IBM :ref:`mainframe` or the power switch on an IBM PC where it really"
" is large and red. \"This ! \\@%$% :ref:`bitty-box` is hung again; time "
"to hit the Big Red Switch.\" Sources at IBM report that, in tune with the"
" company's passion for :ref:`TLA`\\s, this is often abbreviated as BRS "
"(this has also become established on FidoNet and in the PC :ref:`clone` "
"world). It is alleged that the emergency pull switch on an IBM 360/91 "
"actually fired a non-conducting bolt into the main power feed; the BRSes "
"on more recent mainframes physically drop a block into place so that they"
" can't be pushed back in. People get fired for pulling them, especially "
"inappropriately (see also :ref:`molly-guard`\\). Compare :ref:`power-"
"cycle`\\, :ref:`three-finger-salute`\\; see also :ref:`scram-switch`\\."
