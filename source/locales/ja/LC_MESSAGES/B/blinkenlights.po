"Old-time hackers sometimes get nostalgic for blinkenlights because they "
"were so much more fun to look at than a blank panel. Sadly, very few "
"computers still have them (the three LEDs on a PC keyboard certainly "
"don't count). The obvious reasons (cost of wiring, cost of front-panel "
"cutouts, almost nobody needs or wants to interpret machine-register "
"states on the fly anymore) are only part of the story. Another part of it"
" is that radio-frequency leakage from the lamp wiring was beginning to be"
" a problem as far back as transistor machines. But the most fundamental "
"fact is that there are very few signals slow enough to blink an LED these"
" days! With slow CPUs, you could watch the bus register or instruction "
"counter tick, but even at 33/66/150MHz (let alone gigahertz speeds) it's "
"all a blur."

"Despite this, a couple of relatively recent computer designs of note have"
" featured programmable blinkenlights that were added just because they "
"looked cool. The Connection Machine, a 65,536-processor parallel computer"
" designed in the mid-1980s, was a black cube with one side covered with a"
" grid of red blinkenlights; the sales demo had them evolving :ref:`life` "
"patterns. A few years later the ill-fated BeBox (a personal computer "
"designed to run the BeOS operating system) featured twin rows of "
"blinkenlights on the case front. When Be, Inc. decided to get out of the "
"hardware business in 1996 and instead ported their OS to the PowerPC and "
"later to the Intel architecture, many users suffered severely from the "
"absence of their beloved blinkenlights. Before long an external version "
"of the blinkenlights driven by a PC serial port became available; there "
"is some sort of plot symmetry in the fact that it was assembled by a "
"German."

"This newest version partly reflects reports that the word ‘blinkenlights’"
" is (in 1999) undergoing something of a revival in usage, but applied to "
"networking equipment. The transmit and receive lights on routers, "
"activity lights on switches and hubs, and other network equipment often "
"blink in visually pleasing and seemingly coordinated ways. Although this "
"is different in some ways from register readings, a tall stack of Cisco "
"equipment or a 19-inch rack of ISDN terminals can provoke a similar "
"feeling of hypnotic awe, especially in a darkened network operations "
"center or server room."
