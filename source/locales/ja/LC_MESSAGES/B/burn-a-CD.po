"To write a software or document distribution on a CDR. Coined from the "
"fact that a laser is used to inscribe the information by burning small "
"pits in the medium, and from the fact that disk comes out of the drive "
"warm to the touch. Writable CDs can be done on a normal desk-top machine "
"with a suitable drive (so there is no protracted release cycle associated"
" with making them) but each one takes a long time to make, so they are "
"not appropriate for volume production. Writable CDs are suitable for "
"software backups and for short-turnaround-time low-volume software "
"distribution, such as sending a beta release version to a few selected "
"field test sites. Compare :ref:`cut-a-tape`\\."
