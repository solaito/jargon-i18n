"[techspeak] Acronym for Backus Normal Form (later retronymed to Backus-"
"Naur Form because BNF was not in fact a normal form), a metasyntactic "
"notation used to specify the syntax of programming languages, command "
"sets, and the like. Widely used for language descriptions but seldom "
"documented anywhere, so that it must usually be learned by osmosis from "
"other hackers. Consider this BNF for a U.S. postal address:"

msgid ""
"This translates into English as: \"A postal-address consists of a name-"
"part, followed by a street-address part, followed by a zip-code part. A "
"personal-part consists of either a first name or an initial followed by a"
" dot. A name-part consists of either: a personal-part followed by a last "
"name followed by an optional jr-part (Jr., Sr., or dynastic number) and "
"end-of-line, or a personal part followed by a name part (this rule "
"illustrates the use of recursion in BNFs, covering the case of people who"
" use multiple first and middle names and/or initials). A street address "
"consists of an optional apartment specifier, followed by a street number,"
" followed by a street name. A zip-part consists of a town-name, followed "
"by a comma, followed by a state code, followed by a ZIP-code followed by "
"an end-of-line.\" Note that many things (such as the format of a "
"personal-part, apartment specifier, or ZIP-code) are left unspecified. "
"These are presumed to be obvious from context or detailed somewhere "
"nearby. See also :ref:`parse`\\."

"Any of a number of variants and extensions of BNF proper, possibly "
"containing some or all of the :ref:`regexp` wildcards such as :code:`\\*`"
" or :code:`+`\\. In fact the example above isn't the pure form invented "
"for the Algol-60 report; it uses :code:`[]`\\, which was introduced a few"
" years later in IBM's PL/I definition but is now universally recognized."

"In :ref:`science-fiction-fandom`\\, a ‘Big-Name Fan’ (someone famous or "
"notorious). Years ago a fan started handing out black-on-green BNF "
"buttons at SF conventions; this confused the hacker contingent terribly."
