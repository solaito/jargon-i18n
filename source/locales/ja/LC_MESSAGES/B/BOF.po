"together), an informal discussion group and/or bull session scheduled on "
"a conference program. It is not clear where or when this term originated,"
" but it is now associated with the USENIX conferences for Unix techies "
"and was already established there by 1984. It was used earlier than that "
"at DECUS conferences and is reported to have been common at SHARE "
"meetings as far back as the early 1960s."
