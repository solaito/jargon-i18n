"[techspeak; from ‘by one's bootstraps’] To load and initialize the "
"operating system on a machine. This usage is no longer jargon (having "
"passed into techspeak) but has given rise to some derivatives that are "
"still jargon."

"The derivative reboot implies that the machine hasn't been down for long,"
" or that the boot is a :ref:`bounce` (sense 4) intended to clear some "
"state of :ref:`wedgitude`\\. This is sometimes used of human thought "
"processes, as in the following exchange: \"You've lost me.\" \"OK, "
"reboot. Here's the theory....\""

"This term is also found in the variants cold boot (from power-off "
"condition) and warm boot (with the CPU and all devices already powered "
"up, as after a hardware reset or software crash)."

"Another variant: soft boot, reinitialization of only part of a system, "
"under control of other software still running: \"If you're running the "
":ref:`mess-dos` emulator, control-alt-insert will cause a soft-boot of "
"the emulator, while leaving the rest of the system running.\""

"Opposed to this there is hard boot, which connotes hostility towards or "
"frustration with the machine being booted: \"I'll have to hard-boot this "
"losing Sun.\" \"I recommend booting it hard.\" One often hard-boots by "
"performing a :ref:`power-cycle`\\."

"Historical note: this term derives from bootstrap loader, a short program"
" that was read in from cards or paper tape, or toggled in from the front "
"panel switches. This program was always very short (great efforts were "
"expended on making it short in order to minimize the labor and chance of "
"error involved in toggling it in), but was just smart enough to read in a"
" slightly more complex program (usually from a card or paper tape "
"reader), to which it handed control; this program in turn was smart "
"enough to read the application or operating system from a magnetic tape "
"drive or disk drive. Thus, in successive steps, the computer ‘pulled "
"itself up by its bootstraps’ to a useful operating state. Nowadays the "
"bootstrap is usually found in ROM or EPROM, and reads the first stage in "
"from a fixed location on the disk, called the ‘boot block’. When this "
"program gains control, it is powerful enough to load the actual OS and "
"hand control over to it."
