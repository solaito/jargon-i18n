"[common] Feature-encrusted; complex; gaudy; verging on excessive. Said of"
" hardware or (esp.) software designs, this has many of the connotations "
"of :ref:`elephantine` or :ref:`monstrosity` but is less extreme and not "
"pejorative in itself. In the absence of other, more negative descriptions"
" this term suggests that the software is trembling on the edge of bad "
"taste but has not quite tipped over into it. \"Metafont even has features"
" to introduce random variations to its letterform output. Now that is "
"baroque!\" See also :ref:`rococo`\\."
