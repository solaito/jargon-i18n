"A language (such as :ref:`Pascal`\\, Ada, APL, or Prolog) that, though "
"ostensibly general-purpose, is designed so as to enforce an author's "
"theory of ‘right programming’ even though said theory is demonstrably "
"inadequate for systems hacking or even vanilla general-purpose "
"programming. Often abbreviated ‘B&D’; thus, one may speak of things "
"\"having the B&D nature\". See :ref:`Pascal`\\; oppose :ref:`languages-"
"of-choice`\\."
