"[abbreviation, from :samp:`alt.fan.warlord`\\] Big Ugly ASCII Font â€” a "
"special form of :ref:`ASCII-art`\\. Various programs exist for rendering "
"text strings into block, bloob, and pseudo-script fonts in cells between "
"four and six character cells on a side; this is smaller than the letters "
"generated by older :ref:`banner` (sense 2) programs. These are sometimes "
"used to render one's name in a :ref:`sig-block`\\, and are critically "
"referred to as BUAFs. See :ref:`warlording`\\."
