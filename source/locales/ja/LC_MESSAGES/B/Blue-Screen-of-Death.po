"[common] This term is closely related to the older :ref:`Black-Screen-of-"
"Death` but much more common (many non-hackers have picked it up). Due to "
"the extreme fragility and bugginess of Microsoft Windows, misbehaving "
"applications can readily crash the OS (and the OS sometimes crashes "
"itself spontaneously). The Blue Screen of Death, sometimes decorated with"
" hex error codes, is what you get when this happens. (Commonly "
"abbreviated :ref:`BSOD`\\.) The following entry from the `Salon Haiku "

" to have predated popular use of the term:"
