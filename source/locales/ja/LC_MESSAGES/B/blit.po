"[common] To copy a large array of bits from one part of a computer's "
"memory to another part, particularly when the memory is being used to "
"determine what is shown on a display screen. \"The storage allocator "
"picks through the table and copies the good parts up into high memory, "
"and then blits it all back down again.\" See :ref:`bitblt`\\, "
":ref:`BLT`\\, :ref:`dd`\\, :ref:`cat`\\, :ref:`blast`\\, :ref:`snarf`\\. "
"More generally, to perform some operation (such as toggling) on a large "
"array of bits while moving them."

"[historical, rare] Sometimes all-capitalized as BLIT: an early "
"experimental bit-mapped terminal designed by Rob Pike at Bell Labs, later"
" commercialized as the AT&T 5620. (The folk etymology from \"Bell Labs "
"Intelligent Terminal\" is incorrect. Its creators liked to claim that "
"\"Blit\" stood for the Bacon, Lettuce, and Interactive Tomato.)"
