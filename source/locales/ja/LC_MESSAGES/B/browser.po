"A program specifically designed to help users view and navigate "
"hypertext, on-line documentation, or a database. While this general sense"
" has been present in jargon for a long time, the proliferation of "
"browsers for the World Wide Web after 1992 has made it much more popular "
"and provided a central or default techspeak meaning of the word "
"previously lacking in hacker usage. Nowadays, if someone mentions using a"
" ‘browser’ without qualification, one may assume it is a Web browser."
