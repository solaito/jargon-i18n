"An Internet user that leeches off ISPs â€” the sort you can never provide "
"good enough services for, always complains about the price, no matter how"
" low it may be, and will bolt off to another service the moment there is "
"even the slimmest price difference. While most bottom feeders infest free"
" or almost free services such as AOL, MSN, and Hotmail, too many flock to"
" whomever happens to be the cheapest regional ISP at the time. Bottom "
"feeders are often the classic problem user, known for unleashing spam, "
"flamage, and other breaches of :ref:`netiquette`\\."
