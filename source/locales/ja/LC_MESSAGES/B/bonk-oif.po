"In the U.S. :ref:`MUD` community, it has become traditional to express "
"pique or censure by bonking the offending person. Convention holds that "
"one should acknowledge a bonk by saying \"oif!\" and there is a myth to "
"the effect that failing to do so upsets the cosmic bonk/oif balance, "
"causing much trouble in the universe. Some MUDs have implemented special "
"commands for bonking and oifing. Note: in parts of the U.K. ‘bonk’ is a "
"sexually loaded slang term; care is advised in transatlantic "
"conversations (see :ref:`boink`\\). Commonwealth hackers report a similar"
" convention involving the ‘fish/bang’ balance. See also :ref:`talk-"
"mode`\\."
