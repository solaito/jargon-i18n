"A piece of equipment that has been programmed or configured into a "
":ref:`hung`\\, :ref:`wedged`\\,unusable state. Especially used to "
"describe what happens to devices like routers or PDAs that run from "
"firmware when the firmware image is damaged or its settings are somehow "
"patched to impossible values. This term usually implies irreversibility, "
"but equipment can sometimes be unbricked by performing a hard reset or "
"some other drastic operation. Sometimes verbed: \"Yeah, I bricked the "
"router because I forgot about adding in the new access-list. \"."

"modems, routers and other small computing appliances, especially one of "
"the modern type with cords on both ends, as opposed to the older and "
"obnoxious type that plug directly into wall or barrier strip."
