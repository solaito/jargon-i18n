"[abbreviation, \"Basic Combined Programming Language\") A programming "
"language developed by Martin Richards in Cambridge in 1967. It is "
"remarkable for its rich syntax, small size of compiler (it can be run in "
"16k) and extreme portability. It reached break-even point at a very early"
" stage, and was the language in which the original :ref:`hello-world` "
"program was written. It has been ported to so many different systems that"
" its creator confesses to having lost count. It has only one data type (a"
" machine word) which can be used as an integer, a character, a floating "
"point number, a pointer, or almost anything else, depending on context. "
"BCPL was a precursor of C, which inherited some of its features."
