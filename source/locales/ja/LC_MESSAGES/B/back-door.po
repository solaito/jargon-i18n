"[common] A hole in the security of a system deliberately left in place by"
" designers or maintainers. The motivation for such holes is not always "
"sinister; some operating systems, for example, come out of the box with "
"privileged accounts intended for use by field service technicians or the "
"vendor's maintenance programmers. Syn. :ref:`trap-door`\\; may also be "
"called a wormhole. See also :ref:`iron-box`\\, :ref:`cracker`\\, "
":ref:`worm`\\, :ref:`logic-bomb`\\."

"Historically, back doors have often lurked in systems longer than anyone "
"expected or planned, and a few have become widely known. Ken Thompson's "
"1983 Turing Award lecture to the ACM admitted the existence of a back "
"door in early Unix versions that may have qualified as the most "
"fiendishly clever security hack of all time. In this scheme, the C "
"compiler contained code that would recognize when the login command was "
"being recompiled and insert some code recognizing a password chosen by "
"Thompson, giving him entry to the system whether or not an account had "
"been created for him."

"Normally such a back door could be removed by removing it from the source"
" code for the compiler and recompiling the compiler. But to recompile the"
" compiler, you have to *use* the compiler — so Thompson also arranged "
"that the compiler would *recognize when it was compiling a version of "
"itself*\\, and insert into the recompiled compiler the code to insert "
"into the recompiled login the code to allow Thompson entry — and, of "
"course, the code to recognize itself and do the whole thing again the "
"next time around! And having done this once, he was then able to "
"recompile the compiler from the original sources; the hack perpetuated "
"itself invisibly, leaving the back door in place and active but with no "
"trace in the sources."

"The Turing lecture that reported this truly moby hack was later published"
" as \"Reflections on Trusting Trust\", *Communications of the ACM 27*\\, "
"8 (August 1984), pp. 761--763 (text available at "
"`http://www.acm.org/classics/ <http://www.acm.org/classics/sep95/>`_). "
"Ken Thompson has since confirmed that this hack was implemented and that "
"the Trojan Horse code did appear in the login binary of a Unix Support "
"group machine. Ken says the crocked compiler was never distributed. Your "
"editor has heard two separate reports that suggest that the crocked login"
" did make it out of Bell Labs, notably to BBN, and that it enabled at "
"least one late-night login across the network by someone using the login "
"name \"kt\"."
