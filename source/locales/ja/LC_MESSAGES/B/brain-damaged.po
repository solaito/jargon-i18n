"[common; generalization of \"Honeywell Brain Damage\" (HBD), a "
"theoretical disease invented to explain certain utter cretinisms in "
"Honeywell :ref:`Multics`\\] adj. Obviously wrong; :ref:`cretinous`\\; "
":ref:`demented`\\. There is an implication that the person responsible "
"must have suffered brain damage, because he should have known better. "
"Calling something brain-damaged is really bad; it also implies it is "
"unusable, and that its failure to work is due to poor design rather than "
"some accident. \"Only six monocase characters per file name? Now that's "
"brain-damaged!\""
