"Mostly working, but still under test; usu. used with \"in\": in beta. In "
"the :ref:`Real-World`\\, hardware or software systems often go through "
"two stages of release testing: Alpha (in-house) and Beta (out-house?). "
"Beta releases are generally made to a group of lucky (or unlucky) trusted"

"Historical note: More formally, to beta-test is to test a pre-release "
"(potentially unreliable) version of a piece of software by making it "
"available to selected (or self-selected) customers and users. This term "
"derives from early 1960s terminology for product cycle checkpoints, first"
" used at IBM but later standard throughout the industry. Alpha Test was "
"the unit, module, or component test phase; Beta Test was initial system "
"test. These themselves came from earlier A- and B-tests for hardware. The"
" A-test was a feasibility and manufacturability evaluation done before "
"any commitment to design and development. The B-test was a demonstration "
"that the engineering model functioned as specified. The C-test "
"(corresponding to today's beta) was the B-test performed on early samples"
" of the production design, and the D test was the C test repeated after "
"the model had been in production a while."
