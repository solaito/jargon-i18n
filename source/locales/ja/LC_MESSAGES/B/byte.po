"[techspeak] A unit of memory or data equal to the amount used to "
"represent one character; on modern architectures this is invariably 8 "
"bits. Some older architectures used byte for quantities of 6, 7, or "
"(especially) 9 bits, and the PDP-10 supported bytes that were actually "
"bitfields of 1 to 36 bits! These usages are now obsolete, killed off by "
"universal adoption of power-of-2 word sizes."

"Historical note: The term was coined by Werner Buchholz in 1956 during "
"the early design phase for the IBM Stretch computer; originally it was "
"described as 1 to 6 bits (typical I/O equipment of the period used 6-bit "
"chunks of information). The move to an 8-bit byte happened in late 1956, "
"and this size was later adopted and promulgated as a standard by the "
"System/360. The word was coined by mutating the word ‘bite’ so it would "
"not be accidentally misspelled as :ref:`bit`\\. See also :ref:`nybble`\\."
