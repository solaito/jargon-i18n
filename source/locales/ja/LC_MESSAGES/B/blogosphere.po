"The totality of all :ref:`blog`\\s. A culture heavily overlapping with "
"but not coincident with hackerdom; a few of its key coinages ( "
":ref:`blogrolling`\\, :ref:`fisking`\\, :ref:`anti-idiotarianism`\\) are "
"recorded in this lexicon for flavor. Bloggers often divide themselves "
"into warbloggers and techbloggers. The techbloggers write about "
"technology and technology policy, while the warbloggers are more "
"politically focused and tend to be preoccupied with U.S. and world "
"response to the post-9/11 war against terrorism. The overlap with "
"hackerdom is heaviest among the techbloggers, but several of the most "
"prominent warbloggers are also hackers. Bloggers in general tend to be "
"aware of and sympathetic to the hacker culture."
