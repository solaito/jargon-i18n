"obs. Once upon a time, before all-digital switches made it possible for "
"the phone companies to move them out of band, one could actually hear the"
" switching tones used to route long-distance calls. Early "
":ref:`phreaker`\\s built devices called blue boxes that could reproduce "
"these tones, which could be used to commandeer portions of the phone "
"network. (This was not as hard as it may sound; one early phreak acquired"
" the sobriquet \"Captain Crunch\" after he proved that he could generate "
"switching tones with a plastic whistle pulled out of a box of Captain "
"Crunch cereal!) There were other colors of box with more specialized "
"phreaking uses; red boxes, black boxes, silver boxes, etc. There were "
"boxes of `other colors "
