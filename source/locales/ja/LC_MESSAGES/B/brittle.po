"Said of software that is functional but easily broken by changes in "
"operating environment or configuration, or by any minor tweak to the "
"software itself. Also, any system that responds inappropriately and "
"disastrously to abnormal but expected external stimuli; e.g., a file "
"system that is usually totally scrambled by a power failure is said to be"
" brittle. This term is often used to describe the results of a research "
"effort that were never intended to be robust, but it can be applied to "
"commercial software, which (due to closed-source development) displays "
"the quality far more often than it ought to. Oppose :ref:`robust`\\."
