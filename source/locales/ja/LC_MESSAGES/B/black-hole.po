"[common] What data (a piece of email or netnews, or a stream of TCP/IP "
"packets) has fallen into if it disappears mysteriously between its origin"
" and destination sites (that is, without returning a :ref:`bounce-"
"message`\\). \"I think there's a black hole at :code:`foovax`\\!\" "
"conveys suspicion that site :samp:`foovax` has been dropping a lot of "
"stuff on the floor lately (see :ref:`drop-on-the-floor`\\). The implied "
"metaphor of email as interstellar travel is interesting in itself. "
"Readily verbed as blackhole: \"That router is blackholing IDP packets.\" "
"Compare :ref:`bit-bucket` and see :ref:`RBL`\\."
