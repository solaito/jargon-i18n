"(alt. : bit-shift keyboard) A non-standard keyboard layout that seems to "
"have originated with the Teletype ASR-33 and remained common for several "
"years on early computer equipment. The ASR-33 was a mechanical device "
"(see :ref:`EOU`\\), so the only way to generate the character codes from "
"keystrokes was by some physical linkage. The design of the ASR-33 "
"assigned each character key a basic pattern that could be modified by "
"flipping bits if the SHIFT or the CTRL key was pressed. In order to avoid"
" making the thing even more of a kluge than it already was, the design "
"had to group characters that shared the same basic bit pattern on one "
"key."

"This is why the characters ! \"#$%&'() appear where they do on a Teletype"
" (thankfully, they didn't use shift-0 for space). The Teletype Model 33 "
"was actually designed before ASCII existed, and was originally intended "
"to use a code that contained these two rows:"

"The result would have been something closer to a normal keyboard. But as "
"it happened, Teletype had to use a lot of persuasion just to keep ASCII, "
"and the Model 33 keyboard, from looking like this instead:"

"Teletype's was *not* the weirdest variant of the :ref:`QWERTY` layout "
"widely seen, by the way; that prize should probably go to one of several "
"(differing) arrangements on IBM's even clunkier 026 and 029 card punches."

"When electronic terminals became popular, in the early 1970s, there was "
"no agreement in the industry over how the keyboards should be laid out. "
"Some vendors opted to emulate the Teletype keyboard, while others used "
"the flexibility of electronic circuitry to make their product look like "
"an office typewriter. Either choice was supported by the ANSI computer "
"keyboard standard, X4.14-1971, which referred to the alternatives as "
"\"logical bit pairing\" and \"typewriter pairing\". These alternatives "
"became known as bit-paired and typewriter-paired keyboards. To a hacker, "
"the bit-paired keyboard seemed far more logical â€” and because most "
"hackers in those days had never learned to touch-type, there was little "
"pressure from the pioneering users to adapt keyboards to the typewriter "
"standard."

"The doom of the bit-paired keyboard was the large-scale introduction of "
"the computer terminal into the normal office environment, where out-and-"
"out technophobes were expected to use the equipment. The typewriter-"
"paired standard became universal, X4.14 was superseded by X4.23-1982, "
"bit-paired hardware was quickly junked or relegated to dusty corners, and"
" both terms passed into disuse."

"However, in countries without a long history of touch typing, the "
"argument against the bit-paired keyboard layout was weak or nonexistent. "
"As a result, the standard Japanese keyboard, used on PCs, Unix boxen etc."
" still has all of the ! \"#$%&'() characters above the numbers in the "
"ASR-33 layout."
