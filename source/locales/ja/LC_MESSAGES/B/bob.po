"At `Demon Internet <http://www.demon.net/>`_, all tech support personnel "
"are called \"Bob\". (Female support personnel have an option on "
"\"Bobette\"). This has nothing to do with Bob the divine drilling-"
"equipment salesman of the :ref:`Church-of-the-SubGenius`\\. Nor is it "
"acronymized from \"Brother Of :ref:`BOFH`\\\", though all parties agree "
"it could have been. Rather, it was triggered by an unusually large draft "
"of new tech-support people in 1995. It was observed that there would be "
"much duplication of names. To ease the confusion, it was decided that all"
" support techs would henceforth be known as \"Bob\", and identity badges "
"were created labelled \"Bob 1\" and \"Bob 2\". (\"No, we never got any "
"further\" reports a witness)."

"The reason for \"Bob\" rather than anything else is due to a :ref:`luser`"
" calling and asking to speak to \"Bob\", despite the fact that no \"Bob\""
" was currently working for Tech Support. Since we all know \"the customer"
" is always right\", it was decided that there had to be at least one "
"\"Bob\" on duty at all times, just in case."

"This sillyness snowballed inexorably. Shift leaders and managers began to"
" refer to their groups of \"bobs\". Whole ranks of support machines were "
"set up (and still exist in the DNS as of 1999) as bob1 through bobN. Then"
" came :samp:`alt.tech-support.recovery`\\, and it was filled with Demon "
"support personnel. They all referred to themselves, and to others, as "
"\"bob\", and after a while it caught on. There is now a `Bob Code "
"<http://bob.bob.bofh.org/~giolla/bobcode.html>`_\\  describing the Bob "
"nature."
