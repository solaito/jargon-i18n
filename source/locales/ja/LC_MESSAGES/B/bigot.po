"[common] A person who is religiously attached to a particular computer, "
"language, operating system, editor, or other tool (see :ref:`religious-"
"issues`\\). Usually found with a specifier; thus, Cray bigot, ITS bigot, "
"APL bigot, VMS bigot, Berkeley bigot. Real bigots can be distinguished "
"from mere partisans or zealots by the fact that they refuse to learn "
"alternatives even when the march of time and/or technology is threatening"
" to obsolete the favored tool. It is truly said \"You can tell a bigot, "
"but you can't tell him much.\" Compare :ref:`weenie`\\, :ref:`Amiga-"
"Persecution-Complex`\\."
