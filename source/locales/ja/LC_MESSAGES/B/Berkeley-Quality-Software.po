"(often abbreviated \"BQS\") Term used in a pejorative sense to refer to "
"software that was apparently created by rather spaced-out hackers late at"
" night to solve some unique problem. It usually has nonexistent, "
"incomplete, or incorrect documentation, has been tested on at least two "
"examples, and core dumps when anyone else attempts to use it. This term "
"was frequently applied to early versions of the :manpage:`dbx(1)` "
"debugger. See also :ref:`Berzerkeley`\\."
