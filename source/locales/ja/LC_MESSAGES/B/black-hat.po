"[common among security specialists] A :ref:`cracker`\\, someone bent on "
"breaking into the system you are protecting. Oppose the less comon white "
"hat for an ally or friendly security specialist; the term gray hat is in "
"occasional use for people with cracker skills operating within the law, "
"e.g. in doing security evaluations. All three terms derive from the dress"
" code of formulaic Westerns, in which bad guys wore black hats and good "
"guys white ones."

"[spamfighters] ‘Black hat’, ‘white hat’, and ‘gray hat’ are also used to "
"denote the spam-friendliness of ISPs: a black hat ISP harbors spammers "
"and doesn't terminate them; a white hat ISP terminates upon the first "
"LART; and gray hat ISPs terminate only reluctantly and/or slowly. This "
"has led to the concept of a hat check: someone considering a potential "
"business relationship with an ISP or other provider will post a query to "
"a :ref:`NANA` group, asking about the provider's hat color. The term "
"albedo has also been used to describe a provider's spam-friendliness."
