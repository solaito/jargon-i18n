"(alt. : bit diddling or :ref:`bit-twiddling`\\) Term used to describe any"
" of several kinds of low-level programming characterized by manipulation "
"of :ref:`bit`\\, :ref:`flag`\\, :ref:`nybble`\\, and other smaller-than-"
"character-sized pieces of data; these include low-level device control, "
"encryption algorithms, checksum and error-correcting codes, hash "
"functions, some flavors of graphics programming (see :ref:`bitblt`\\), "
"and assembler/compiler code generation. May connote either tedium or a "
"real technical challenge (more usually the former). \"The command "
"decoding for the new tape driver looks pretty solid but the bit-bashing "
"for the control registers still has bugs.\" See also :ref:`mode-bit`\\."
