"A programming language, originally designed for Dartmouth's experimental "
"timesharing system in the early 1960s, which for many years was the "
"leading cause of brain damage in proto-hackers. Edsger W. Dijkstra "
"observed in *Selected Writings on Computing: A Personal Perspective* that"
" \"It is practically impossible to teach good programming style to "
"students that have had prior exposure to BASIC: as potential programmers "
"they are mentally mutilated beyond hope of regeneration.\" This is "
"another case (like :ref:`Pascal`\\) of the cascading :ref:`lossage` that "
"happens when a language deliberately designed as an educational toy gets "
"taken too seriously. A novice can write short BASIC programs (on the "
"order of 10-20 lines) very easily; writing anything longer (a) is very "
"painful, and (b) encourages bad habits that will make it harder to use "
"more powerful languages well. This wouldn't be so bad if historical "
"accidents hadn't made BASIC so common on low-end micros in the 1980s. As "
"it is, it probably ruined tens of thousands of potential wizards."
