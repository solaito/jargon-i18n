"[very common; always pronounced as if capitalized. Orig. fr. the 1930 "
"Sellar & Yeatman parody of British history *1066 And All That*\\, but "
"well-established among hackers in the U.S. as well.] Something that can't"
" possibly result in improvement of the subject. This term is always "
"capitalized, as in \"Replacing all of the DSL links with bicycle couriers"
" would be a Bad Thing\". Oppose :ref:`Good-Thing`\\. British "
"correspondents confirm that :ref:`Bad-Thing` and :ref:`Good-Thing` (and "
"prob. therefore :ref:`Right-Thing` and :ref:`Wrong-Thing`\\) come from "
"the book referenced in the etymology, which discusses rulers who were "
"Good Kings but Bad Things. This has apparently created a mainstream idiom"
" on the British side of the pond. It is very common among American "
"hackers, but not in mainstream usage in the U.S. Compare :ref:`Bad-and-"
"Wrong`\\."
