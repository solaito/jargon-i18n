"[very common; by analogy with proton/electron/neutron, but doubtless "
"reinforced after 1980 by the similarity to Douglas Adams's ‘Vogons’; see "
"the :ref:`Bibliography<bibliography>` in Appendix C and note that Arthur "
"Dent actually mispronounces ‘Vogons’ as ‘Bogons’ at one point]"

"The elementary particle of bogosity (see :ref:`quantum-bogodynamics`\\). "
"For instance, \"the Ethernet is emitting bogons again\" means that it is "
"broken or acting in an erratic or bogus fashion."

"A person who is bogus or who says bogus things. This was historically the"

"The bogon has become the type case for a whole bestiary of nonce particle"
" names, including the ‘clutron’ or ‘cluon’ (indivisible particle of "
"cluefulness, obviously the antiparticle of the bogon) and the futon "
"(elementary particle of :ref:`randomness`\\, or sometimes of lameness). "
"These are not so much live usages in themselves as examples of a live "
"meta-usage: that is, it has become a standard joke or linguistic maneuver"
" to \"explain\" otherwise mysterious circumstances by inventing nonce "
"particle names. And these imply nonce particle theories, with all their "
"dignity or lack thereof (we might note parenthetically that this is a "
"generalization from \"(bogus particle) theories\" to \"bogus (particle "
"theories)\"!). Perhaps such particles are the modern-day equivalents of "
"trolls and wood-nymphs as standard starting-points around which to "
"construct explanatory myths. Of course, playing on an existing word (as "
"in the ‘futon’) yields additional flavor. Compare :ref:`magic-smoke`\\."
