"Synonym for :ref:`blit`\\. This is the original form of :ref:`blit` and "
"the ancestor of :ref:`bitblt`\\. It referred to any large bit-field copy "
"or move operation (one resource-intensive memory-shuffling operation done"
" on pre-paged versions of ITS, WAITS, and TOPS-10 was sardonically "
"referred to as \"The Big BLT\"). The jargon usage has outlasted the "
":ref:`PDP-10` BLock Transfer instruction from which :ref:`BLT` derives; "
"nowadays, the assembler mnemonic :ref:`BLT` almost always means \"Branch "
"if Less Than zero\"."
