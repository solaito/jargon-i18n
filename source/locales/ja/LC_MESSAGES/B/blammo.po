"[Oxford Brookes University and alumni, UK] To forcibly remove someone "
"from any interactive system, especially talker systems. The operators, "
"who may remain hidden, may \"blammo\" a user who is misbehaving. Very "
"similar to archaic MIT gun; in fact, the blammo-gun is a notional device "
"used to \"blammo\" someone. While in actual fact the only incarnation of "
"the blammo-gun is the command used to forcibly eject a user, operators "
"speak of different levels of blammo-gun fire; e.g., a blammo-gun to "
"‘stun’ will temporarily remove someone, but a blammo-gun set to ‘maim’ "
"will stop someone coming back on for a while."
