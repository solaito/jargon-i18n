"The most famous :ref:`pseudo`\\, and the prototypical :ref:`newbie`\\. "
"Articles from B1FF feature all uppercase letters sprinkled liberally with"
" bangs, typos, ‘cute’ misspellings (EVRY BUDY LUVS GOOD OLD BIFF CUZ KØØL"
" DOOD AN HE RITES REEL AWESUM THINGZ IN CAPITULL LETTRS LIKE THIS!!! ), "
"use (and often misuse) of fragments of :ref:`talk-mode` abbreviations, a "
"long :ref:`sig-block` (sometimes even a :ref:`doubled-sig`\\), and "
"unbounded naivete. B1FF posts articles using his elder brother's VIC-20. "
"B1FF's location is a mystery, as his articles appear to come from a "
"variety of sites. However, BITNET seems to be the most frequent origin. "
"The theory that B1FF is a denizen of BITNET is supported by B1FF's "
"(unfortunately invalid) electronic mail address: B1FF\\@BIT.NET."

"[1993: Now It Can Be Told! My spies inform me that B1FF was originally "
"created by Joe Talmadge <jat@cup.hp.com>, also the author of the infamous"
" and much-plagiarized \"Flamer's Bible\". The BIFF filter he wrote was "
"later passed to Richard Sexton, who posted BIFFisms much more widely. "
"Versions have since been posted for the amusement of the net at large. "
