"A group of large-site administrators who pushed through the :ref:`Great-"
"Renaming` and reined in the chaos of :ref:`Usenet` during most of the "
"1980s. During most of its lifetime, the Cabal (as it was sometimes "
"capitalized) steadfastly denied its own existence; it was almost "
"obligatory for anyone privy to their secrets to respond \"There is no "
"Cabal\" whenever the existence or activities of the group were speculated"
" on in public."

"The result of this policy was an attractive aura of mystery. Even a "
"decade after the cabal :ref:`mailing-list` disbanded in late 1988 "
"following a bitter internal catfight, many people believed (or claimed to"
" believe) that it had not actually disbanded but only gone deeper "
"underground with its power intact."

"This belief became a model for various paranoid theories about various "
"Cabals with dark nefarious objectives beginning with taking over the "
"Usenet or Internet. These paranoias were later satirized in ways that "
"took on a life of their own. See :ref:`Eric-Conspiracy` for one example. "
"Part of the background for this kind of humor is that many hackers "
"cultivate a fondness for conspiracy theory considered as a kind of "
"surrealist art; see the bibliography entry on *Illuminatus!* for the "
"novel that launched this trend."
