"[common] Said of an operation (especially a repetitive, trivial, and/or "
"tedious one) that ought to be performed automatically by the computer, "
"but which a hacker instead has to step tediously through. \"My mailer "
"doesn't have a command to include the text of the message I'm replying "
"to, so I have to do it by hand.\" This does not necessarily mean the "
"speaker has to retype a copy of the message; it might refer to, say, "
"dropping into a subshell from the mailer, making a copy of one's mailbox "
"file, reading that into an editor, locating the top and bottom of the "
"message in question, deleting the rest of the file, inserting \\`>' "
"characters on each line, writing the file, leaving the editor, returning "
"to the mailer, reading the file in, and later remembering to delete the "
"file. Compare :ref:`eyeball-search`\\."

"[common] By extension, writing code which does something in an explicit "
"or low-level way for which a presupplied library routine ought to have "
"been available. \"This cretinous B-tree library doesn't supply a decent "
"iterator, so I'm having to walk the trees by hand.\""
