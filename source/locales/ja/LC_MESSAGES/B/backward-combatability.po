"[CMU, Tektronix: from backward compatibility] A property of hardware or "
"software revisions in which previous protocols, formats, layouts, etc. "
"are irrevocably discarded in favor of ‘new and improved’ protocols, "
"formats, and layouts, leaving the previous ones not merely deprecated but"
" actively defeated. (Too often, the old and new versions cannot "
"definitively be distinguished, such that lingering instances of the "
"previous ones yield crashes or other infelicitous effects, as opposed to "
"a simple \"version mismatch\" message.) A backwards compatible change, on"
" the other hand, allows old versions to coexist without crashes or error "
"messages, but too many major changes incorporating elaborate backwards "
"compatibility processing can lead to extreme :ref:`software-bloat`\\. See"
" also :ref:`flag-day`\\."
