"Describes a computer architecture in which, within a given multi-byte "
"numeric representation, the most significant byte has the lowest address "
"(the word is stored ‘big-end-first’). Most processors, including the IBM "
"370 family, the :ref:`PDP-10`\\, the Motorola microprocessor families, "
"and most of the various RISC designs are big-endian. Big-endian byte "
"order is also sometimes called network order. See :ref:`little-endian`\\,"
" :ref:`middle-endian`\\, :ref:`NUXI-problem`\\, :ref:`swab`\\."

"An Internet address the wrong way round. Most of the world follows the "
"Internet standard and writes email addresses starting with the name of "
"the computer and ending up with the name of the country. In the U.K.: the"
" Joint Academic Networking Team had decided to do it the other way round "
"before the Internet domain standard was established. Most gateway sites "
"have :ref:`ad-hockery` in their mailers to handle this, but can still be "
"confused. In particular, the address :samp:`me\\@uk.ac.bris.pys.as` could"
" be interpreted in JANET's big-endian way as one in the U.K. (domain "
":samp:`uk`\\) or in the standard little-endian way as one in the domain "
":samp:`as` (American Samoa) on the opposite side of the world."
