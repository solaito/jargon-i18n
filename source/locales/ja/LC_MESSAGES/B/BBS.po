"[common; abbreviation, \"Bulletin Board System\"] An electronic bulletin "
"board system; that is, a message database where people can log in and "
"leave broadcast messages for others grouped (typically) into :ref:`topic-"
"group`\\s. The term was especially applied to the thousands of local BBS "
"systems that operated during the pre-Internet microcomputer era of "
"roughly 1980 to 1995, typically run by amateurs for fun out of their "
"homes on MS-DOS boxes with a single modem line each. Fans of Usenet and "
"Internet or the big commercial timesharing bboards such as CompuServe and"
" GEnie tended to consider local BBSes the low-rent district of the hacker"
" culture, but they served a valuable function by knitting together lots "
"of hackers and users in the personal-micro world who would otherwise have"
" been unable to exchange code at all. Post-Internet, BBSs are likely to "
"be local newsgroups on an ISP; efficiency has increased but a certain "
"flavor has been lost. See also :ref:`bboard`\\."
