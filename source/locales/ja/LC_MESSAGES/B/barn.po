"[uncommon; prob. from the nuclear military] An unexpectedly large "
"quantity of something: a unit of measurement. \"Why is /var/adm taking up"
" so much space?\" \"The logs have grown to several barns.\" The source of"
" this is clear: when physicists were first studying nuclear interactions,"
" the probability was thought to be proportional to the cross-sectional "
"area of the nucleus (this probability is still called the cross-section)."
" Upon experimenting, they discovered the interactions were far more "
"probable than expected; the nuclei were \"as big as a barn\". The units "
"for cross-sections were christened Barns, (10-24 cm2) and the book "
"containing cross-sections has a picture of a barn on the cover."
