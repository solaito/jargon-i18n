"A measurement of the severity of spam invented by long-time hacker Seth "
"Breidbart, used for programming cancelbots. The Breidbart Index takes "
"into account the fact that excessive multi-posting :ref:`EMP` is worse "
"than excessive cross-posting :ref:`ECP`\\. The Breidbart Index is "
"computed as follows: For each article in a spam, take the square-root of "
"the number of newsgroups to which the article is posted. The Breidbart "
"Index is the sum of the square roots of all of the posts in the spam. For"
" example, one article posted to nine newsgroups and again to sixteen "
"would have BI = sqrt(9) + sqrt(16) = 7. It is generally agreed that a "
"spam is cancelable if the Breidbart Index exceeds 20."

"The Breidbart Index accumulates over a 45-day window. Ten articles "
"yesterday and ten articles today and ten articles tomorrow add up to a "
"30-article spam. Spam fighters will often reset the count if you can "
"convince them that the spam was accidental and/or you have seen the error"
" of your ways and won't repeat it. Breidbart Index can accumulate over "
"multiple authors. For example, the \"Make Money Fast\" pyramid scheme "
"exceeded a BI of 20 a long time ago, and is now considered \"cancel on "
"sight\"."
