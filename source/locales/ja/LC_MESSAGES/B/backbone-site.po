"Formerly, a key Usenet and email site, one that processes a large amount "
"of third-party traffic, especially if it is the home site of any of the "
"regional coordinators for the Usenet maps. Notable backbone sites as of "
"early 1993, when this sense of the term was beginning to pass out of "
"general use due to wide availability of cheap Internet connections, "
"included :samp:`uunet` and the mail machines at Rutgers University, UC "
"Berkeley, :ref:`DEC`\\'s Western Research Laboratories, Ohio State "
"University, and the University of Texas. Compare :ref:`leaf-site`\\."
