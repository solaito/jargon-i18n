"Used of an algorithm or implementation considered extremely "
":ref:`robust`\\; lossage-resistant; capable of correctly recovering from "
"any imaginable exception condition â€” a rare and valued quality. Implies "
"that the programmer has thought of all possible errors, and added "
":ref:`code` to protect against each one. Thus, in some cases, this can "
"imply code that is too heavyweight, due to excessive paranoia on the part"
" of the programmer. Syn. :ref:`armor-plated`\\."
