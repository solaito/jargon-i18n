"A surprising piece of code found in some program. While usually not "
"wrong, it tends to vary from :ref:`crufty` to :ref:`bletcherous`\\, and "
"has lain undiscovered only because it was functionally correct, however "
"horrible it is. Used sarcastically, because what is found is anything "
"*but* treasure. Buried treasure almost always needs to be dug up and "
"removed. \"I just found that the scheduler sorts its queue using :ref"
":`bubble-sort`\\! Buried treasure!\""
