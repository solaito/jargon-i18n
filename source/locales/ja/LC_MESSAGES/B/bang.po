"n\\. Common spoken name for ``!`` (ASCII 0100001), especially when used "
"in pronouncing a :ref:`bang-path` in spoken hackish. In :ref:`elder-days`"
" this was considered a CMUish usage, with MIT and Stanford hackers "
"preferring :ref:`excl` or :ref:`shriek`\\; but the spread of Unix has "
"carried ‘bang’ with it (esp. via the term :ref:`bang-path`\\) and it is "
"now certainly the most common spoken name for ``!``\\. Note that it is "
"used exclusively for non-emphatic written ``!``\\; one would not say "
"\"Congratulations bang\" (except possibly for humorous purposes), but if "
"one wanted to specify the exact characters \"foo!\" one would speak \"Eff"
" oh oh bang\". See :ref:`shriek`\\, :ref:`ASCII`\\."

"interj. An exclamation signifying roughly \"I have achieved "
"enlightenment! \", or \"The dynamite has cleared out my brain!\" Often "
"used to acknowledge that one has perpetrated a :ref:`thinko` immediately "
"after one has been called on it."
