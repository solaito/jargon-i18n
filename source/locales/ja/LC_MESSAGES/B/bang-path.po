"[now historical] An old-style UUCP electronic-mail address specifying "
"hops to get from some assumed-reachable location to the addressee, so "
"called because each :ref:`hop` is signified by a :ref:`bang` sign. Thus, "
"for example, the path :samp:`...!bigsite!foovax!barbox!me` directs people"
" to route their mail to machine :samp:`bigsite` (presumably a well-known "
"location accessible to everybody) and from there through the machine "
":samp:`foovax` to the account of user :samp:`me` on :samp:`barbox`\\."

"In the bad old days of not so long ago, before autorouting mailers and "
"Internet became commonplace, people often published compound bang "
"addresses using the { } convention (see :ref:`glob`\\) to give paths from"
" *several* big machines, in the hopes that one's correspondent might be "
"able to get mail to one of them reliably (example: :samp:`...! {seismo, "
"ut-sally, ihnp4`\\!rice!beta!gamma!me}). Bang paths of 8 to 10 hops were "
"not uncommon. Late-night dial-up UUCP links would cause week-long "
"transmission times. Bang paths were often selected by both transmission "
"time and reliability, as messages would not infrequently get lost. See "
":ref:`the-network` and :ref:`sitename`\\."
