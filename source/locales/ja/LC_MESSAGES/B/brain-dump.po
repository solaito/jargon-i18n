"[common] The act of telling someone everything one knows about a "
"particular topic or project. Typically used when someone is going to let "
"a new party maintain a piece of code. Conceptually analogous to an "
"operating system :ref:`core-dump` in that it saves a lot of useful "
":ref:`state` before an exit. \"You'll have to give me a brain dump on "
"FOOBAR before you start your new job at HackerCorp.\" See :ref:`core-"
"dump` (sense 4). At Sun, this is also known as TOI (transfer of "
"information)."
