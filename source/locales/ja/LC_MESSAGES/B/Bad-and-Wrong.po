"[Durham, UK] Said of something that is both badly designed and wrongly "
"executed. This common term is the prototype of, and is used by contrast "
"with, three less common terms â€” Bad and Right (a kludge, something ugly "
"but functional); Good and Wrong (an overblown GUI or other attractive "
"nuisance); and (rare praise) Good and Right. These terms entered common "
"use at Durham c.1994 and may have been imported from elsewhere; they are "
"also in use at Oxford, and the emphatic form \"Evil and Bad and Wrong\" "
"(abbreviated EBW) is reported from there. There are standard "
"abbreviations: they start with B&R, a typo for \"Bad and Wrong\". "
"Consequently, B&W is actually \"Bad and Right\", G&R = \"Good and "
"Wrong\", and G&W = \"Good and Right\". Compare :ref:`evil-and-rude`\\, "
":ref:`Good-Thing`\\, :ref:`Bad-Thing`\\."
