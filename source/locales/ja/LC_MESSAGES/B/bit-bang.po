"Transmission of data on a serial line, when accomplished by rapidly "
"tweaking a single output bit, in software, at the appropriate times. The "
"technique is a simple loop with eight OUT and SHIFT instruction pairs for"
" each byte. Input is more interesting. And full duplex (doing input and "
"output at the same time) is one way to separate the real hackers from the"
" :ref:`wannabee`\\s."

"Bit bang was used on certain early models of Prime computers, presumably "
"when UARTs were too expensive, and on archaic Z80 micros with a Zilog PIO"
" but no SIO. In an interesting instance of the :ref:`cycle-of-"
"reincarnation`\\, this technique returned to use in the early 1990s on "
"some RISC architectures because it consumes such an infinitesimal part of"
" the processor that it actually makes sense not to have a UART. Compare "
":ref:`cycle-of-reincarnation`\\. Nowadays it's used to describe I2C, a "
"serial protocol for monitoring motherboard hardware."
