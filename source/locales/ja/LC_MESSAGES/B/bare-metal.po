"[common] New computer hardware, unadorned with such snares and delusions "
"as an :ref:`operating-system`\\, an :ref:`HLL`\\, or even assembler. "
"Commonly used in the phrase programming on the bare metal, which refers "
"to the arduous work of :ref:`bit-bashing` needed to create these basic "
"tools for a new machine. Real bare-metal programming involves things like"
" building boot proms and BIOS chips, implementing basic monitors used to "
"test device drivers, and writing the assemblers that will be used to "
"write the compiler back ends that will give the new machine a real "
"development environment."

"\"Programming on the bare metal\" is also used to describe a style of "
":ref:`hand-hacking` that relies on bit-level peculiarities of a "
"particular hardware design, esp. tricks for speed and space optimization "
"that rely on crocks such as overlapping instructions (or, as in the "
"famous case described in :ref:`The Story of Mel'<story-of-mel>` (in "
"Appendix A), interleaving of opcodes on a magnetic drum to minimize fetch"
" delays due to the device's rotational latency). This sort of thing has "
"become rare as the relative costs of programming time and machine "
"resources have changed, but is still found in heavily constrained "
"environments such as industrial embedded systems. See :ref:`Real-"
"Programmer`\\."
