"[common] To do a task in background is to do it whenever "
":ref:`foreground` matters are not claiming your undivided attention, and "
"to background something means to relegate it to a lower priority. \"For "
"now, we'll just print a list of nodes and links; I'm working on the "
"graph-printing problem in background.\" Note that this implies ongoing "
"activity but at a reduced level or in spare time, in contrast to "
"mainstream ‘back burner’ (which connotes benign neglect until some future"
" resumption of activity). Some people prefer to use the term for "
"processing that they have queued up for their unconscious minds (a tack "
"that one can often fruitfully take upon encountering an obstacle in "
"creative work). Compare :ref:`amp-off`\\, :ref:`slopsucker`\\."

"Technically, a task running in background is detached from the terminal "
"where it was started (and often running at a lower priority); oppose "
":ref:`foreground`\\. Nowadays this term is primarily associated with "
":ref:`Unix`\\, but it appears to have been first used in this sense on "
"OS/360."
