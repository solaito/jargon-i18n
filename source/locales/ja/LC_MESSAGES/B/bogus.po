"Astrology is bogus. So is a bolt that is obviously about to break. So is "
"someone who makes blatantly false claims to have solved a scientific "
"problem. (This word seems to have some, but not all, of the connotations "
"of :ref:`random` — mostly the negative ones.)"

"It is claimed that bogus was originally used in the hackish sense at "
"Princeton in the late 1960s. It was spread to CMU and Yale by Michael "
"Shamos, a migratory Princeton alumnus. A glossary of bogus words was "
"compiled at Yale when the word was first popularized there about 1975-76."
" These coinages spread into hackerdom from CMU and MIT. Most of them "
"remained wordplay objects rather than actual vocabulary items or live "
"metaphors. Examples: amboguous (having multiple bogus interpretations); "
"bogotissimo (in a gloriously bogus manner); bogotophile (one who is "
"pathologically fascinated by the bogus); paleobogology (the study of "
"primeval bogosity)."

"Some bogowords, however, obtained sufficient live currency to be listed "
"elsewhere in this lexicon; see :ref:`bogometer`\\, :ref:`bogon`\\, "
":ref:`bogotify`\\, and :ref:`quantum-bogodynamics` and the related but "
"unlisted :ref:`Dr--Fred-Mbogo`\\."

"By the early 1980s ‘bogus’ was also current in something like hacker "
"usage sense in West Coast teen slang, and it had gone mainstream by 1985."
" A correspondent from Cambridge reports, by contrast, that these uses of "
"bogus grate on British nerves; in Britain the word means, rather "
"specifically, ‘counterfeit’, as in \"a bogus 10-pound note\". According "
"to Merriam-Webster, the word dates back to 1825 and originally referred "
"to a counterfeiting machine."
