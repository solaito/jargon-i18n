"[common] Also :ref:`bit-decay`\\. Hypothetical disease the existence of "
"which has been deduced from the observation that unused programs or "
"features will often stop working after sufficient time has passed, even "
"if ‘nothing has changed’. The theory explains that bits decay as if they "
"were radioactive. As time passes, the contents of a file or the code in a"
" program will become increasingly garbled."

"There actually are physical processes that produce such effects (alpha "
"particles generated by trace radionuclides in ceramic chip packages, for "
"example, can change the contents of a computer memory unpredictably, and "
"various kinds of subtle media failures can corrupt files in mass "
"storage), but they are quite rare (and computers are built with error-"
"detecting circuitry to compensate for them). The notion long favored "
"among hackers that cosmic rays are among the causes of such events turns "
"out to be a myth; see the :ref:`cosmic-rays` entry for details."
