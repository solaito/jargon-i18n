"[now rare] To notify someone of incoming mail. From the BSD utility "
":manpage:`biff(1)`\\, which was in turn named after a friendly dog who "
"used to chase frisbees in the halls at UCB while 4.2BSD was in "
"development. There was a legend that it had a habit of barking whenever "
"the mailman came, but the author of :code:`biff` says this is not true. "
"No relation to :ref:`B1FF`\\."
