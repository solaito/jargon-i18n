"[from \"book-of-the-month club\", a time-honored mail-order-marketing "
"technique in the U.S.] A mythical club which users of "
":manpage:`sendmail(8)` (the Unix mail daemon) belong to; this was coined "
"on the Usenet newsgroup comp.security.unix at a time when sendmail "
"security holes, which allowed outside :ref:`cracker`\\s access to the "
"system, were being uncovered at an alarming rate, forcing sysadmins to "
"update very often. Also, more completely, fatal security bug-of-the-month"
" club. See also :ref:`kernel-of-the-week-club`\\."
