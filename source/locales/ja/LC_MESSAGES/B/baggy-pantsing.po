"[Georgia Tech] A \"baggy pantsing\" is used to reprimand hackers who "
"incautiously leave their terminals unlocked. The affected user will come "
"back to find a post from them on internal newsgroups discussing exactly "
"how baggy their pants are, an accepted stand-in for \"unattentive user "
"who left their work unprotected in the clusters\". A properly-done baggy "
"pantsing is highly mocking and humorous. It is considered bad form to "
"post a baggy pantsing to off-campus newsgroups or the more technical, "
"serious groups. A particularly nice baggy pantsing may be \"claimed\" by "
"immediately quoting the message in full, followed by your :ref:`sig-"
"block`\\; this has the added benefit of keeping the embarassed victim "
"from being able to delete the post. Interesting baggy-pantsings have been"
" done involving adding commands to login scripts to repost the message "
"every time the unlucky user logs in; Unix boxes on the residential "
"network, when cracked, oftentimes have their homepages replaced (after "
"being politely backed-up to another file) with a baggy-pants message; "
".plan files are also occasionally targeted. Usage: \"Prof. Greenlee fell "
"asleep in the Solaris cluster again; we baggy-pantsed him to "
":code:`git.cc.class.2430.flame`\\.\" Compare :ref:`derf`\\."
