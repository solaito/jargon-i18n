"(alt. : blast an EPROM, burn an EPROM) To program a read-only memory, "
"e.g. : for use with an embedded system. This term arose because the "
"programming process for the Programmable Read-Only Memories (PROMs) that "
"preceded present-day Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memories (EPROMs) "
"involved intentionally blowing tiny electrical fuses on the chip. The "
"usage lives on (it's too vivid and expressive to discard) even though the"
" write process on EPROMs is nondestructive."
