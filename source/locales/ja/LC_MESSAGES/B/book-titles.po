"There is a tradition in hackerdom of informally tagging important "
"textbooks and standards documents with the dominant color of their covers"
" or with some other conspicuous feature of the cover. Many of these are "
"described in this lexicon under their own entries. See :ref:`Aluminum-"
"Book`\\, :ref:`Camel-Book`\\, :ref:`Cinderella-Book`\\, :ref:`daemon-"
"book`\\, :ref:`Dragon-Book`\\, :ref:`Orange-Book`\\, :ref:`Purple-"
"Book`\\, :ref:`Wizard-Book`\\, and :ref:`bible`\\; see also :ref"
":`rainbow-series`\\. Since about 1993 this tradition has gotten a boost "
"from the popular O'Reilly and Associates line of technical books, which "
"usually feature some kind of exotic animal on the cover and are often "
"called by the name of that animal."
