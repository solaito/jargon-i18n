"[common] A collection of arcane, unpublished, and (by implication) mostly"
" ad-hoc techniques developed for a particular application or systems area"
" (compare :ref:`black-magic`\\). VLSI design and compiler code "
"optimization were (in their beginnings) considered classic examples of "
"black art; as theory developed they became :ref:`deep-magic`\\, and once "
"standard textbooks had been written, became merely :ref:`heavy-"
"wizardry`\\. The huge proliferation of formal and informal channels for "
"spreading around new computer-related technologies during the last twenty"
" years has made both the term black art and what it describes less common"
" than formerly. See also :ref:`voodoo-programming`\\."
