"[IBM] Patch wires (esp. 30 AWG gauge) added to circuit boards at the "
"factory to correct design or fabrication problems. Blue wire is not "
"necessarily blue, the term describes function rather than color. These "
"may be necessary if there hasn't been time to design and qualify another "
"board version. In Great Britain this can be bodge wire, after mainstream "
"slang bodge for a clumsy improvisation or sloppy job of work. Compare "
":ref:`purple-wire`\\, :ref:`red-wire`\\, :ref:`yellow-wire`\\, :ref"
