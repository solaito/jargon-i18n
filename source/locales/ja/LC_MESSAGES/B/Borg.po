"In *Star Trek: The Next Generation* the Borg is a species of cyborg that "
"ruthlessly seeks to incorporate all sentient life into itself; their "
"slogan is \"You will be assimilated. Resistance is futile.\" In hacker "
"parlance, the Borg is usually :ref:`Microsoft`\\, which is thought to be "
"trying just as ruthlessly to assimilate all computers and the entire "
"Internet to itself (there is a widely circulated image of Bill Gates as a"
" Borg). Being forced to use Windows or NT is often referred to as being "
"\"Borged\". Interestingly, the :ref:`Halloween-Documents` reveal that "
"this jargon is live within Microsoft itself. See also :ref:`Evil-"
"Empire`\\, :ref:`Internet-Exploiter`\\."

"Other companies, notably Intel and UUNet, have also occasionally been "
"equated to the Borg. In IETF circles, where direct pressure from "
"Microsoft is not a daily reality, the Borg is sometimes Cisco. This usage"
" commemorates their tendency to pay any price to hire talent away from "
"their competitors. In fact, at the Spring 1997 IETF, a large number of "
"ex-Cisco employees, all former members of Routing Geeks, showed up with "
"t-shirts printed with \"Recovering Borg\"."
