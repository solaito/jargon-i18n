"A now-legendary games company, active from 1979 to 1989, that "
"commercialized the MDL parser technology used for :ref:`Zork` to produce "
"a line of text adventure games that remain favorites among hackers. "
"Infocom's games were intelligent, funny, witty, erudite, irreverent, "
"challenging, satirical, and most thoroughly hackish in spirit. The "
"physical game packages from Infocom are now prized collector's items. "
"After being acquired by Activision in 1989 they did a few more \"modern\""
" (e.g. graphics-intensive) games which were less successful than reissues"
" of their classics."

"The software, thankfully, is still extant; Infocom games were written in "
"a kind of P-code (called, actually, z-code) and distributed with a P-code"
" interpreter core, and not only open-source emulators for that "
"interpreter but an actual compiler as well have been written to permit "
"the P-code to be run on platforms the games never originally graced. In "
"fact, new games written in this P-code are still being written. There is "
"a home page at `http://www.csd.uwo.ca/Infocom/ "
"<http://www.csd.uwo.ca/Infocom/>`_, and it is even possible to play these"
" games in your `browser <http://www.xs4all.nl/~pot/infocom/>`_\\  if it "
"is Java-capable."
