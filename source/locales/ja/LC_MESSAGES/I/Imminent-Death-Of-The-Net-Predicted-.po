"[Usenet] Since :ref:`Usenet` first got off the ground in 1980--81, it has"
" grown exponentially, approximately doubling in size every year. On the "
"other hand, most people feel the :ref:`signal-to-noise-ratio` of Usenet "
"has dropped steadily. These trends led, as far back as mid-1983, to "
"predictions of the imminent collapse (or death) of the net. Ten years and"
" numerous doublings later, enough of these gloomy prognostications have "
"been confounded that the phrase \"Imminent Death Of The Net Predicted!\" "
"has become a running joke, hauled out any time someone grumbles about the"
" :ref:`S-N-ratio` or the huge and steadily increasing volume, or the "
"possible loss of a key node or link, or the potential for lawsuits when "
"ignoramuses post copyrighted material, etc., etc., etc."
