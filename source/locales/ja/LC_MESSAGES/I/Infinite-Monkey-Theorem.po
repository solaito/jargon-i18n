"\"If you put an :ref:`infinite` number of monkeys at typewriters, "
"eventually one will bash out the script for Hamlet.\" (One may also "
"hypothesize a small number of monkeys and a very long period of time.) "
"This theorem asserts nothing about the intelligence of the one "
":ref:`random` monkey that eventually comes up with the script (and note "
"that the mob will also type out all the possible *incorrect* versions of "
"Hamlet). It may be referred to semi-seriously when justifying a :ref"
":`brute-force` method; the implication is that, with enough resources "
"thrown at it, any technical challenge becomes a :ref:`one-banana-"
"problem`\\. This argument gets more respect since :ref:`Linux` justified "
"the :ref:`bazaar` mode of development."

"In mid-2002, researchers at Plymouth Univesity in England actually put a "
"working computer in a cage with six crested macaques. The monkeys "
"proceeded to bash the machine with a rock, urinate on it, and type the "
"letter S a lot (later, the letters A, J, L, and M also crept in). The "
"results were published in a limited-edition book, *Notes Towards The "
"Complete Works of Shakespeare*\\. A researcher reported: \"They were "
"quite interested in the screen, and they saw that when they typed a "
"letter, something happened. There was a level of intention there.\" "
"Scattered field reports that there are AOL users this competent have been"
" greeted with well-deserved skepticism."

"This theorem has been traced to the mathematiciamn Émile Borel in 1913, "
"and was first popularized by the astronomer Sir Arthur Eddington. It "
"became part of the idiom of techies via the classic SF short story "
"`Inflexible Logic <http://www.janda.org/c10/readings/monkeys.htm>`_\\  by"
" Russell Maloney, and many younger hackers know it through a reference in"
" Douglas Adams's *Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy*\\. Some other "
"references have been `collected on the Web "
"<http://www.angelfire.com/in/hypnosonic/Parable_of_the_Monkeys.html>`_. "
"On 1 April 2000 the usage acquired its own Internet standard, `RFC2795 "
"<http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2795.txt>`_\\  (Infinite Monkey Protocol "
"Suite)."
