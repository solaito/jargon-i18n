"[common] Consisting of a large number of objects; extreme. Used very "
"loosely as in: \"This program produces infinite garbage.\" \"He is an "
"infinite loser.\" The word most likely to follow infinite, though, is "
":ref:`hair`\\. (It has been pointed out that fractals are an excellent "
"example of infinite hair.) These uses are abuses of the word's "
"mathematical meaning. The term semi-infinite, denoting an immoderately "
"large amount of some resource, is also heard. \"This compiler is taking a"
" semi-infinite amount of time to optimize my program.\" See also "
":ref:`semi`\\."
