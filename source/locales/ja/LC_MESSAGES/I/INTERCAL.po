"[said by the authors to stand for Compiler Language With No Pronounceable"
" Acronym] A computer language designed by Don Woods and James Lyons in "
"1972. INTERCAL is purposely different from all other computer languages "
"in all ways but one; it is purely a written language, being totally "
"unspeakable. An excerpt from the INTERCAL Reference Manual will make the "
"style of the language clear:"

"INTERCAL has many other peculiar features designed to make it even more "
"unspeakable. The Woods-Lyons implementation was actually used by many "
"(well, at least several) people at Princeton. The language has been "
"recently reimplemented as C-INTERCAL and is consequently enjoying an "
"unprecedented level of unpopularity; there is even an "
":samp:`alt.lang.intercal` newsgroup devoted to the study and ... "
"appreciation of the language on Usenet."

"Inevitably, INTERCAL has a home page on the Web: "
"`http://www.catb.org/~esr/intercal/ "
"<http://www.catb.org/~esr/intercal/>`_. An extended version, implemented "
"in (what else?) :ref:`Perl` and adding object-oriented features, is "
"rumored to exist. See also :ref:`Befunge`\\."
