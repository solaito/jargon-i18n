"An aggrieved cry often heard as bugs manifest during a regression test. "
"The :ref:`canonical` reply to this assertion is \"Then it works just the "
"same as it did before, doesn't it?\" See also :ref:`one-line-fix`\\. This"
" is also heard from applications programmers trying to blame an obvious "
"applications problem on an unrelated systems software change, for example"
" a divide-by-0 fault after terminals were added to a network. Usually, "
"their statement is found to be false. Upon close questioning, they will "
"admit some major restructuring of the program that shouldn't have broken "
"anything, in their opinion, but which actually :ref:`hosed` the code "
"completely."
