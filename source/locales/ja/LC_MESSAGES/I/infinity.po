"minus infinity: The smallest such value, not necessarily or even usually "
"the simple negation of plus infinity. In ``N``\\-bit twos-complement "
"arithmetic, infinity is :math:`2^{N-1}` but minus infinity is :math:`- "
"(2^{N-1}`\\, not :math:`-(2^{N-1}`\\. Note also that this is different "
"from time T equals minus infinity, which is closer to a mathematician's "
"usage of infinity."
