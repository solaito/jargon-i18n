"[IRC] An :ref:`IRC` version of the trivia game \"Botticelli\", in which "
"one user changes his :ref:`nick` to the initials of a famous person or "
"other named entity, and the others on the channel ask yes or no "
"questions, with the one to guess the person getting to be \"it\" next. As"
" a courtesy, the one picking the initials starts by providing a 4-letter "
"hint of the form sex, nationality, life-status, reality-status. For "
"example, MAAR means \"Male, American, Alive, Real\" (as opposed to "
"\"fictional\"). Initgame can be surprisingly addictive. See also "
":ref:`hing`\\."
