"[Linux community since c.1998] Common portmanteau word for \"installation"
" festival\"; Linux user groups frequently run these. Computer users are "
"invited to bring their machines to have Linux installed on their "
"machines. The idea is to get them painlessly over the biggest hump in "
"migrating to Linux, which is initially installing and configuring it for "
"the user's machine."
