"This may derive from the \"NATO standard\" cup of coffee and tea (milk "
"and two sugars), military slang going back to the late 1950s and "
"parodying NATO's relentless bureaucratic drive to standardize parts "
"across European and U.S. militaries."

"Like many ISO standards, this one has a faintly alien ring in North "
"America, where hackers generally shun the decadent British practice of "
"adulterating perfectly good tea with dairy products and prefer instead to"
" add a wedge of lemon, if anything. If one were feeling extremely silly, "
"one might hypothesize an analogous ANSI standard cup of tea and wind up "
"with a political situation distressingly similar to several that arise in"
" much more serious technical contexts. (Milk and lemon don't mix very "
"well.)"

"equivalent to British Standard BS6008: *How to make a standard cup of "
"tea.* —ESR]"
