"[Unix/Internet] A special environment set up to trap a :ref:`cracker` "
"logging in over remote connections long enough to be traced. May include "
"a modified :ref:`shell` restricting the cracker's movements in unobvious "
"ways, and ‘bait’ files designed to keep him interested and logged on. See"
" also :ref:`back-door`\\, :ref:`firewall-machine`\\, :ref:`Venus-"
"flytrap`\\, and Clifford Stoll's account in * The Cuckoo's Egg* of how he"
" made and used one (see the :ref:`Bibliography<bibliography>` in Appendix"
