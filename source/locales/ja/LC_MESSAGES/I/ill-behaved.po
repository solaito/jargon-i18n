"[obs.] Software that bypasses the defined :ref:`OS` interfaces to do "
"things (like screen, keyboard, and disk I/O) itself, often in a way that "
"depends on the hardware of the machine it is running on or which is "
"nonportable or incompatible with other pieces of software. In the MS-DOS "
"world, there was a folk theorem (nearly true) to the effect that (owing "
"to gross inadequacies and performance penalties in the OS interface) all "
"interesting applications were ill-behaved. See also :ref:`bare-metal`\\. "
"Oppose :ref:`well-behaved`\\. See also :ref:`mess-dos`\\."

"In modern usage, a program is called ill-behaved if it uses interfaces to"
" the OS or other programs that are private, undocumented, or grossly non-"
"portable. Another way to be ill-behaved is to use headers or files that "
"are theoretically private to another application."
