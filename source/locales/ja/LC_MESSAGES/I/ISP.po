"Common abbreviation for Internet Service Provider, a kind of company that"
" barely existed before 1993. ISPs sell Internet access to the mass "
"market. While the big nationwide commercial BBSs with Internet access "
"(like America Online, CompuServe, GEnie, Netcom, etc.) are technically "
"ISPs, the term is usually reserved for local or regional small providers "
"(often run by hackers turned entrepreneurs) who resell Internet access "
"cheaply without themselves being information providers or selling "
"advertising. Compare :ref:`NSP`\\."
