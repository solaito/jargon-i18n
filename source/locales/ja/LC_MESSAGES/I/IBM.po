"From hackerdom's beginnings in the mid-1960s to the early 1990s, IBM was "
"regarded with active loathing. Common expansions of the corporate name "
"included: Inferior But Marketable; It's Better Manually; Insidious Black "
"Magic; It's Been Malfunctioning; Incontinent Bowel Movement; and a near- "
":ref:`infinite` number of even less complimentary expansions (see also "
":ref:`fear-and-loathing`\\). What galled hackers about most IBM machines "
"above the PC level wasn't so much that they were underpowered and "
"overpriced (though that counted against them), but that the designs were "
"incredibly archaic, :ref:`crufty`\\, and :ref:`elephantine` ... and you "
"couldn't *fix* them — source code was locked up tight, and programming "
"tools were expensive, hard to find, and bletcherous to use once you had "
"found them."

"We didn't know how good we had it back then. In the 1980s IBM had its own"
" troubles with Microsoft and lost its strategic way, receding from the "
"hacker community's view. Then, in the 1990s, Microsoft became more "
"noxious and omnipresent than IBM had ever been."

"In the late 1990s IBM re-invented itself as a services company, began to "
"release open-source software through its AlphaWorks group, and began "
"shipping :ref:`Linux` systems and building ties to the Linux community. "
"To the astonishment of all parties, IBM emerged as a staunch friend of "
"the hacker community and :ref:`open-source` development, with ironic "
"consequences noted in the :ref:`FUD` entry."
