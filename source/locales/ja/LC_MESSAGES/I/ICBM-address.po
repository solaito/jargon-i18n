"(Also missile address) The form used to register a site with the Usenet "
"mapping project, back before the day of pervasive Internet, included a "
"blank for longitude and latitude, preferably to seconds-of-arc accuracy. "
"This was actually used for generating geographically-correct maps of "
"Usenet links on a plotter; however, it became traditional to refer to "
"this as one's ICBM address or missile address, and some people include it"
" in their :ref:`sig-block` with that name. (A real missile address would "
"include target elevation.)"
