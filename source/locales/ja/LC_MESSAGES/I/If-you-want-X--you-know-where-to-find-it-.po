"There is a legend that Dennis Ritchie, inventor of :ref:`C`\\, once "
"responded to demands for features resembling those of what at the time "
"was a much more popular language by observing \"If you want PL/I, you "
"know where to find it.\" Ever since, this has been hackish standard form "
"for fending off requests to alter a new design to mimic some older (and, "
"by implication, inferior and :ref:`baroque`\\) one. The case X = "
":ref:`Pascal` manifests semi-regularly on Usenet's :samp:`comp.lang.c` "
"newsgroup. Indeed, the case X = X has been reported in discussions of "
"graphics software (see :ref:`X`\\)."
