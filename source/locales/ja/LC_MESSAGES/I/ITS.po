"Incompatible Time-sharing System, an influential though highly "
"idiosyncratic operating system written for PDP-6s and PDP-10s at MIT and "
"long used at the MIT AI Lab. Much AI-hacker jargon derives from ITS "
"folklore, and to have been ‘an ITS hacker’ qualifies one instantly as an "
"old-timer of the most venerable sort. ITS pioneered many important "
"innovations, including transparent file sharing between machines and "
"terminal-independent I/O. After about 1982, most actual work was shifted "
"to newer machines, with the remaining ITS boxes run essentially as a "
"hobby and service to the hacker community. The shutdown of the lab's last"
" ITS machine in May 1990 marked the end of an era and sent old-time "
"hackers into mourning nationwide (see :ref:`high-moby`\\). There is an "
"`ITS home page <http://www.its.os.org/>`_."

"A mythical image of operating-system perfection worshiped by a bizarre, "
"fervent retro-cult of old-time hackers and ex-users (see "
":ref:`troglodyte`\\, sense 2). ITS worshipers manage somehow to continue "
"believing that an OS maintained by assembly-language hand-hacking that "
"supported only monocase 6-character filenames in one directory per "
"account remains superior to today's state of commercial art (their venom "
"against :ref:`Unix` is particularly intense). See also :ref:`holy-"
"wars`\\, :ref:`Weenix`\\."
