"[Internet Relay Chat] A worldwide \"party line\" network that allows one "
"to converse with others in real time. IRC is structured as a network of "
"Internet servers, each of which accepts connections from client programs,"
" one per user. The IRC community and the :ref:`Usenet` and :ref:`MUD` "
"communities overlap to some extent, including both hackers and regular "
"folks who have discovered the wonders of computer networks. Some Usenet "
"jargon has been adopted on IRC, as have some conventions such as "
":ref:`emoticon`\\s. There is also a vigorous native jargon, represented "
"in this lexicon by entries marked ‘[IRC]’. See also :ref:`talk-mode`\\."
