msgid ""
"The most obvious common ‘personality’ characteristics of hackers are high"
" intelligence, consuming curiosity, and facility with intellectual "
"abstractions. Also, most hackers are ‘neophiles’, stimulated by and "
"appreciative of novelty (especially intellectual novelty). Most are also "
"relatively individualistic and anti-conformist."

"Although high general intelligence is common among hackers, it is not the"
" *sine qua non* one might expect. Another trait is probably even more "
"important: the ability to mentally absorb, retain, and reference large "
"amounts of ‘meaningless’ detail, trusting to later experience to give it "
"context and meaning. A person of merely average analytical intelligence "
"who has this trait can become an effective hacker, but a creative genius "
"who lacks it will swiftly find himself outdistanced by people who "
"routinely upload the contents of thick reference manuals into their "
"brains. [During the production of the first book version of this "
"document, for example, I learned most of the rather complex typesetting "
"language TeX over about four working days, mainly by inhaling Knuth's "
"477-page manual. My editor's flabbergasted reaction to this genuinely "
"surprised me, because years of associating with hackers have conditioned "
"me to consider such performances routine and to be expected. —ESR]"

"Contrary to stereotype, hackers are *not* usually intellectually narrow; "
"they tend to be interested in any subject that can provide mental "
"stimulation, and can often discourse knowledgeably and even interestingly"
" on any number of obscure subjects — if you can get them to talk at all, "
"as opposed to, say, going back to their hacking."

msgid ""
"It is noticeable (and contrary to many outsiders' expectations) that the "
"better a hacker is at hacking, the more likely he or she is to have "
"outside interests at which he or she is more than merely competent."

msgid ""
"Hackers are ‘control freaks’ in a way that has nothing to do with the "
"usual coercive or authoritarian connotations of the term. In the same way"
" that children delight in making model trains go forward and back by "
"moving a switch, hackers love making complicated things like computers do"
" nifty stuff for them. But it has to be *their* nifty stuff. They don't "
"like tedium, nondeterminism, or most of the fussy, boring, ill-defined "
"little tasks that go with maintaining a normal existence. Accordingly, "
"they tend to be careful and orderly in their intellectual lives and "
"chaotic elsewhere. Their code will be beautiful, even if their desks are "
"buried in 3 feet of crap."

msgid ""
"Hackers are generally only very weakly motivated by conventional rewards "
"such as social approval or money. They tend to be attracted by challenges"
" and excited by interesting toys, and to judge the interest of work or "
"other activities in terms of the challenges offered and the toys they get"
" to play with."

#: ../../personality.rst:32
msgid ""
"In terms of Myers-Briggs and equivalent psychometric systems, hackerdom "
"appears to concentrate the relatively rare INTJ and INTP types; that is, "
"introverted, intuitive, and thinker types (as opposed to the extroverted-"
"sensate personalities that predominate in the mainstream culture). "
"ENT[JP] types are also concentrated among hackers but are in a minority."
