"Any one of several similar folk theorems that fit computing capacity or "
"cost to a 2t exponential curve, with doubling time close to a year. The "
"most common fits component density to such a curve (previous versions of "
"this entry gave that form). Another variant asserts that the dollar cost "
"of constant computing power decreases on the same curve. The original "
"Moore's Law, first uttered in 1965 by semiconductor engineer Gordon Moore"
" (who co-founded Intel four years later), spoke of the number of "
"components on the lowest-cost silicon integrated circuits â€” but Moore's "
"own formulation varied somewhat over the years, and reconstructing the "
"meaning of the terminology he used in the original turns out to be "
"fraught with difficulties. Further variants were spawned by Intel's PR "
"department and various journalists."

"It has been `shown "
"<http://firstmonday.org/issues/issue7_11/tuomi/index.html>`_\\  that none"
" of the variants of Moore's Law actually fit the data very well (the "
"price curves within DRAM generations perhaps come closest). Nevertheless,"
" Moore's Law is constantly invoked to set up expectations about the next "
"generation of computing technology. See also :ref:`Parkinsons-Law-of-"
"Data` and :ref:`Gatess-Law`\\."
