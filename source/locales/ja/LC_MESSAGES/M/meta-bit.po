"Historical note: although in modern usage shaped by a universe of 8-bit "
"bytes the meta bit is invariably hex 80 (octal 0200), things were "
"different on earlier machines with 36-bit words and 9-bit bytes. The MIT "
"and Stanford keyboards (see :ref:`space-cadet-keyboard`\\) generated hex "
"100 (octal 400) from their meta keys."
