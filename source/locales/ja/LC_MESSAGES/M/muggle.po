"[from J.K. Rowling's *Harry Potter* books, 1998] A non- :ref:`wizard`\\. "
"Not as disparaging as :ref:`luser`\\; implies vague pity rather than "
"contempt. In the universe of Rowling's enormously (and deservedly) "

"world, but each group is ignorant of the commonplaces of the others' "
"existence â€” most muggles are unaware that wizards exist, and wizards "
"(used to magical ways of doing everything) are perplexed and fascinated "
"by muggle artifacts."
