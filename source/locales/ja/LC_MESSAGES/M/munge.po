"This term is often confused with :ref:`mung`\\, which probably was "
"derived from it. However, it also appears the word munge was in common "
"use in Scotland in the 1940s, and in Yorkshire in the 1950s, as a verb, "
"meaning to munch up into a masticated mess, and as a noun, meaning the "
"result of munging something up (the parallel with the :ref:`kluge`\\/ "
":ref:`kludge` pair is amusing). The OED reports \"munge\" as an archaic "
"verb meaning \"to wipe (a person's nose)\"."
