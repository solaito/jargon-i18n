"[from \"MULTiplexed Information and Computing Service\"] An early "
"timesharing :ref:`operating-system` co-designed by a consortium including"
" MIT, GE, and Bell Laboratories as a successor to :ref:`CTSS`\\. The "
"design was first presented in 1965, planned for operation in 1967, first "
"operational in 1969, and took several more years to achieve respectable "
"performance and stability."

"Multics was very innovative for its time — among other things, it "
"provided a hierarchical file system with access control on individual "
"files and introduced the idea of treating all devices uniformly as "
"special files. It was also the first OS to run on a symmetric "
"multiprocessor, and the only general-purpose system to be awarded a B2 "
"security rating by the NSA (see :ref:`Orange-Book`\\)."

"Bell Labs left the development effort in 1969 after judging that :ref"
":`second-system-effect` had bloated Multics to the point of practical "
"unusability. Honeywell commercialized Multics in 1972 after buying out "
"GE's computer group, but it was never very successful: at its peak in the"
" 1980s, there were between 75 and 100 Multics sites, each a multi-million"
" dollar mainframe."

"One of the former Multics developers from Bell Labs was Ken Thompson, and"
" :ref:`Unix` deliberately carried through and extended many of Multics' "
"design ideas; indeed, Thompson described the very name ‘Unix’ as \"a weak"
" pun on Multics\". For this and other reasons, aspects of the Multics "
"design remain a topic of occasional debate among hackers. See also :ref"
":`brain-damaged` and :ref:`GCOS`\\."

"MIT ended its development association with Multics in 1977. Honeywell "
"sold its computer business to Bull in the mid 80s, and development on "
"Multics was stopped in 1988. Four Multics sites were known to be still in"
" use as late as 1998, but the last one (a Canadian military site) was "
"decommissioned in November 2000. There is a Multics page at "
