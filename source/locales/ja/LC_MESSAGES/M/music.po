"A common extracurricular interest of hackers (compare :ref:`science-"
"fiction-fandom`\\, :ref:`oriental-food`\\; see also :ref:`filk`\\). "
"Hackish folklore has long claimed that musical and programming abilities "
"are closely related, and there has been at least one large-scale "
"statistical study that supports this. Hackers, as a rule, like music and "
"often develop musical appreciation in unusual and interesting directions."
" Folk music is very big in hacker circles; so is electronic music, and "
"the sort of elaborate instrumental jazz/rock that used to be called "
"‘progressive’ and isn't recorded much any more. The hacker's musical "
"range tends to be wide; many can listen with equal appreciation to (say) "
"Talking Heads, Yes, Gentle Giant, Pat Metheny, Scott Joplin, Tangerine "
"Dream, Dream Theater, King Sunny Ade, The Pretenders, Screaming Trees, or"
" the Brandenburg Concerti. It is also apparently true that hackerdom "
"includes a much higher concentration of talented amateur musicians than "
"one would expect from a similar-sized control group of :ref:`mundane` "
"types."
