"An abbreviation of the full name :ref:`Microsoft` resembling the rather "
":ref:`bogus` way Windows 9x's VFAT filesystem truncates long file names "
"to fit in the MS-DOS 8+3 scheme (the real filename is stored elsewhere). "
"If other files start with the same prefix, they'll be called micros~2 and"
" so on, causing lots of problems with backups and other routine system-"
"administration problems. During the US Antitrust trial against Microsoft "
"the names Micros~1 and Micros~2 were suggested for the two companies that"
" would exist after a break-up."
