"[coined by analogy with ‘gene’, by Richard Dawkins] An idea considered as"
" a :ref:`replicator`\\, esp. with the connotation that memes parasitize "
"people into propagating them much as viruses do. Used esp. in the phrase "
"meme complex denoting a group of mutually supporting memes that form an "
"organized belief system, such as a religion. This lexicon is an "
"(epidemiological) vector of the ‘hacker subculture’ meme complex; each "
"entry might be considered a meme. However, meme is often misused to mean "
"meme complex. Use of the term connotes acceptance of the idea that in "
"humans (and presumably other tool- and language-using sophonts) cultural "
"evolution by selection of adaptive ideas has superseded biological "
"evolution by selection of hereditary traits. Hackers find this idea "
"congenial for tolerably obvious reasons."
