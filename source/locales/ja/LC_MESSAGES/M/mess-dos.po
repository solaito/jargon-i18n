"[semi-obsolescent now that DOS is] Derisory term for MS-DOS. Often "
"followed by the ritual banishing \"Just say No!\" See :ref:`MS-DOS`\\. "
"Most hackers (even many MS-DOS hackers) loathed MS-DOS for its single-"
"tasking nature, its limits on application size, its nasty primitive "
"interface, and its ties to IBMness and Microsoftness (see :ref:`fear-and-"
"loathing`\\). Also mess-loss, messy-dos, mess-dog, mess-dross, mush-dos, "
"and various combinations thereof. In Ireland and the U.K. it is even "
"sometimes called ‘Domestos’ after a brand of toilet cleanser."
