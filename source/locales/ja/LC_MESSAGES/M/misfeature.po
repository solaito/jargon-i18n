"[common] A feature that eventually causes lossage, possibly because it is"
" not adequate for a new situation that has evolved. Since it results from"
" a deliberate and properly implemented feature, a misfeature is not a "
"bug. Nor is it a simple unforeseen side effect; the term implies that the"
" feature in question was carefully planned, but its long-term "
"consequences were not accurately or adequately predicted (which is quite "
"different from not having thought ahead at all). A misfeature can be a "
"particularly stubborn problem to resolve, because fixing it usually "
"involves a substantial philosophical change to the structure of the "
"system involved."

"Many misfeatures (especially in user-interface design) arise because the "
"designers/implementors mistake their personal tastes for laws of nature. "
"Often a former feature becomes a misfeature because trade-offs were made "
"whose parameters subsequently change (possibly only in the judgment of "
"the implementors). \"Well, yeah, it is kind of a misfeature that file "
"names are limited to six characters, but the original implementors wanted"
" to save directory space and we're stuck with it for now.\""
