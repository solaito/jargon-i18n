"A substance trapped inside IC packages that enables them to function "
"(also called blue smoke; this is similar to the archaic phlogiston "
"hypothesis about combustion). Its existence is demonstrated by what "
"happens when a chip burns up — the magic smoke gets let out, so it "
"doesn't work any more. See :ref:`smoke-test`\\, :ref:`let-the-smoke-"
"out`\\."

"Usenetter Jay Maynard tells the following story: \"Once, while hacking on"
" a dedicated Z80 system, I was testing code by blowing EPROMs and "
"plugging them in the system, then seeing what happened. One time, I "
"plugged one in backwards. I only discovered that after I realized that "
"Intel didn't put power-on lights under the quartz windows on the tops of "
"their EPROMs — the die was glowing white-hot. Amazingly, the EPROM worked"
" fine after I erased it, filled it full of zeros, then erased it again. "
"For all I know, it's still in service. Of course, this is because the "
"magic smoke didn't get let out.\" Compare the original phrasing of :ref"
":`Murphys-Law`\\."
