"[MS-DOS] Pixels (usually single) that are not properly restored when the "
"mouse pointer moves away from a particular location on the screen, "
"producing the appearance that the mouse pointer has left droppings "
"behind. The major causes for this problem are programs that write to the "
"screen memory corresponding to the mouse pointer's current location "
"without hiding the mouse pointer first, and mouse drivers that do not "
"quite support the graphics mode in use."
