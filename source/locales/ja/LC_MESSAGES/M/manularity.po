"[prob. fr. techspeak manual + granularity] A notional measure of the "
"manual labor required for some task, particularly one of the sort that "
"automation is supposed to eliminate. \"Composing English on paper has "
"much higher manularity than using a text editor, especially in the "
"revising stage.\" Hackers tend to consider manularity a symptom of "
"primitive methods; in fact, a true hacker confronted with an apparent "
"requirement to do a computing task :ref:`by-hand` will inevitably seize "
"the opportunity to build another tool (see :ref:`toolsmith`\\)."
