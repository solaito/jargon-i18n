"1/1000000 of the fundamental unit of time in the Furlong/Firkin/Fortnight"
" system of measurement; 1.2096 sec. (A furlong is 1/8th of a mile; a "
"firkin is 9 imperial gallons; the mass unit of the system is taken to be "
"a firkin of water). The VMS operating system has a lot of tuning "
"parameters that you can set with the SYSGEN utility, and one of these is "
"TIMEPROMPTWAIT, the time the system will wait for an operator to set the "
"correct date and time at boot if it realizes that the current value is "
"bogus. This time is specified in microfortnights!"
