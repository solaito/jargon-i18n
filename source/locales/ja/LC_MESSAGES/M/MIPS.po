"A measure of computing speed; formally, ‘Million Instructions Per Second’"
" (that's :math:`10^{6}` per second, not :math:`2^{20}`\\! ); often "
"rendered by hackers as ‘Meaningless Indication of Processor Speed’ or in "
"other unflattering ways, such as ‘Meaningless Information Provided by "
"Salesmen’. This joke expresses an attitude nearly universal among hackers"
" about the value of most :ref:`benchmark` claims, said attitude being one"
" of the great cultural divides between hackers and :ref:`marketroid`\\s "
"(see also :ref:`BogoMIPS`\\). The singular is sometimes ‘1 MIP’ even "
"though this is clearly etymologically wrong. See also :ref:`KIPS` and "
":ref:`GIPS`\\."
