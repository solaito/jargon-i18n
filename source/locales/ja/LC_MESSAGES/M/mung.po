"Like many early hacker terms, this one seems to have originated at "
":ref:`TMRC`\\; it was already in use there in 1958. Peter Samson "
"(compiler of the original TMRC lexicon) thinks it may originally have "
"been onomatopoeic for the sound of a relay spring (contact) being "
"twanged. However, it is known that during the World Wars, ‘mung’ was "
"U.S.: army slang for the ersatz creamed chipped beef better known as "
"‘SOS’, and it seems quite likely that the word in fact goes back to "
"Scots-dialect :ref:`munge`\\."

"Charles Mackay's 1874 book *Lost Beauties of the English Language* "
"defined \"mung\" as follows: \"Preterite of ming, to ming or mingle; when"
" the substantive meaning of mingled food of bread, potatoes, etc. thrown "
"to poultry. In America, \"mung news\" is a common expression applied to "
"false news, but probably having its derivation from mingled (or mung) "
"news, in which the true and the false are so mixed up together that it is"
" impossible to distinguish one from another.\""
