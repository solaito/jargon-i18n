"The unit of :ref:`bogosity`\\. Abbreviated µL or mL in ASCII Consensus is"
" that this is the largest unit practical for everyday use. The "
"microLenat, originally invented by David Jefferson, was promulgated as an"
" attack against noted computer scientist Doug Lenat by a :ref:`tenured-"
"graduate-student` at CMU. Doug had failed the student on an important "
"exam because the student gave only \"AI is bogus\" as his answer to the "
"questions. The slur is generally considered unmerited, but it has become "
"a running gag nevertheless. Some of Doug's friends argue that *of course*"
" a microLenat is bogus, since it is only one millionth of a Lenat. Others"
" have suggested that the unit should be redesignated after the grad "
"student, as the microReid."
