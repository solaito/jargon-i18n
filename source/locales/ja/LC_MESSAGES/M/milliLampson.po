"A unit of talking speed, abbreviated mL. Most people run about 200 "
"milliLampsons. The eponymous Butler Lampson (a CS theorist and systems "
"implementor highly regarded among hackers) goes at 1000. A few people "
"speak faster. This unit is sometimes used to compare the (sometimes "
"widely disparate) rates at which people can generate ideas and actually "
"emit them in speech. For example, noted computer architect C. Gordon Bell"
" (designer of the :ref:`PDP-11`\\) is said, with some awe, to think at "
"about 1200 mL but only talk at about 300; he is frequently reduced to "
"fragments of sentences as his mouth tries to keep up with his speeding "
"brain."
