"A :ref:`display-hack` dating back to the PDP-1 (ca. 1962, reportedly "
"discovered by Jackson Wright), which employs a trivial computation "
"(repeatedly plotting the graph Y = X XOR T for successive values of T â€” "
"see :ref:`HAKMEM` items 146--148) to produce an impressive display of "
"moving and growing squares that devour the screen. The initial value of T"
" is treated as a parameter, which, when well-chosen, can produce amazing "
"effects. Some of these, later (re)discovered on the LISP machine, have "
"been christened munching triangles (try AND for XOR and toggling points "
"instead of plotting them), munching w's, and munching mazes. More "
"generally, suppose a graphics program produces an impressive and ever-"
"changing display of some basic form, foo, on a display terminal, and does"
" it using a relatively simple program; then the program (or the resulting"
" display) is likely to be referred to as munching foos. [This is a good "
"example of the use of the word :ref:`foo` as a :ref:`metasyntactic-"
"variable`\\.]"
