"A class of :ref:`virtual-reality` experiments accessible via the "
"Internet. These are real-time chat forums with structure; they have "
"multiple ‘locations’ like an adventure game, and may include combat, "
"traps, puzzles, magic, a simple economic system, and the capability for "
"characters to build more structure onto the database that represents the "
"existing world."

"Historically, MUDs (and their more recent progeny with names of MU- form)"
" derive from a hack by Richard Bartle and Roy Trubshaw on the University "
"of Essex's DEC-10 in the early 1980s; descendants of that game still "
"exist today and are sometimes generically called *BartleMUD*\\s. There is"
" a widespread myth (repeated, unfortunately, by earlier versions of this "
"lexicon) that the name MUD was trademarked to the commercial MUD run by "
"Bartle on British Telecom (the motto: \"You haven't lived 'til you've "
"died on MUD! \"); however, this is false — Richard Bartle explicitly "
"placed ‘MUD’ in the public domain in 1985. BT was upset at this, as they "
"had already printed trademark claims on some maps and posters, which were"
" released and created the myth."

"Students on the European academic networks quickly improved on the MUD "
"concept, spawning several new MUDs (VAXMUD, AberMUD, LPMUD). Many of "
"these had associated bulletin-board systems for social interaction. "
"Because these had an image as ‘research’ they often survived "
"administrative hostility to BBSs in general. This, together with the fact"
" that Usenet feeds were often spotty and difficult to get in the U.K., "
"made the MUDs major foci of hackish social interaction there."

"AberMUD and other variants crossed the Atlantic around 1988 and quickly "
"gained popularity in the U.S.; they became nuclei for large hacker "
"communities with only loose ties to traditional hackerdom (some observers"
" see parallels with the growth of Usenet in the early 1980s). The second "
"wave of MUDs (TinyMUD and variants) tended to emphasize social "
"interaction, puzzles, and cooperative world-building as opposed to combat"
" and competition (in writing, these social MUDs are sometimes referred to"
" as ‘MU\\*’, with ‘MUD’ implicitly reserved for the more game-oriented "
"ones). By 1991, over 50% of MUD sites were of a third major variety, "
"LPMUD, which synthesizes the combat/puzzle aspects of AberMUD and older "
"systems with the extensibility of TinyMud. In 1996 the cutting edge of "
"the technology is Pavel Curtis's MOO, even more extensible using a built-"
"in object-oriented language. The trend toward greater programmability and"
" flexibility will doubtless continue."

"The state of the art in MUD design is still moving very rapidly, with new"
" simulation designs appearing (seemingly) every month. Around 1991 there "
"was an unsuccessful movement to deprecate the term :ref:`MUD` itself, as "
"newer designs exhibit an exploding variety of names corresponding to the "
"different simulation styles being explored. It survived. See also :ref"
":`bonk-oif`\\, :ref:`FOD`\\, :ref:`link-dead`\\, :ref:`mudhead`\\, :ref"
":`talk-mode`\\."
