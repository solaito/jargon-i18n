"[MicroSoft Disk Operating System] A :ref:`clone` of :ref:`CP-M` for the "
"8088 crufted together in 6 weeks by hacker Tim Paterson at Seattle "
"Computer Products, who called the original QDOS (Quick and Dirty "
"Operating System) and is said to have regretted it ever since. Microsoft "
"licensed QDOS in order to have something to demo for IBM on time, and the"
" rest is history. Numerous features, including vaguely Unix-like but "
"rather broken support for subdirectories, I/O redirection, and pipelines,"
" were hacked into Microsoft's 2.0 and subsequent versions; as a result, "
"there are two or more incompatible versions of many system calls, and MS-"
"DOS programmers can never agree on basic things like what character to "
"use as an option switch or whether to be case-sensitive. The resulting "
"appalling mess is now the highest-unit-volume OS in history. Often known "
"simply as DOS, which annoys people familiar with other similarly "
"abbreviated operating systems (the name goes back to the mid-1960s, when "
"it was attached to IBM's first disk operating system for the 360). The "
"name further annoys those who know what the term :ref:`operating-system` "
"does (or ought to) connote; DOS is more properly a set of relatively "
"simple interrupt services. Some people like to pronounce DOS like "
"\"dose\", as in \"I don't work on dose, man! \", or to compare it to a "
"dose of brain-damaging drugs (a slogan button in wide circulation among "
"hackers exhorts: \"MS-DOS: Just say No!\"). See :ref:`mess-dos`\\."
