"[from :ref:`wart` by analogy with :ref:`misbug`\\] A :ref:`feature` that "
"superficially appears to be a :ref:`wart` but has been determined to be "
"the :ref:`Right-Thing`\\. For example, in some versions of the "
":ref:`EMACS` text editor, the ‘transpose characters’ command exchanges "
"the character under the cursor with the one before it on the screen, "
"*except* when the cursor is at the end of a line, in which case the two "
"characters before the cursor are exchanged. While this behavior is "
"perhaps surprising, and certainly inconsistent, it has been found through"
" extensive experimentation to be what most users want. This feature is a "
"miswart."
