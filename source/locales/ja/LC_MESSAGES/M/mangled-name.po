"A name, appearing in a C++ object file, that is a coded representation of"
" the object declaration as it appears in the source. Mangled names are "
"used because C++ allows multiple objects to have the same name, as long "
"as they are distinguishable in some other way, such as by having "
"different parameter types. Thus, the internal name must have that "
"additional information embedded in it, using the limited character set "
"allowed by most linkers. For instance, one popular compiler encodes the "
"standard library function declaration \"memchr(const void\\*,int,unsigned"
" int)\" as \"\\@memchr$qpxviui\"."
