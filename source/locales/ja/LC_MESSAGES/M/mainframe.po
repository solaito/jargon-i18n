"Term originally referring to the cabinet containing the central processor"
" unit or ‘main frame’ of a room-filling :ref:`Stone-Age` batch machine. "
"After the emergence of smaller minicomputer designs in the early 1970s, "
"the traditional :ref:`big-iron` machines were described as ‘mainframe "
"computers’ and eventually just as mainframes. The term carries the "
"connotation of a machine designed for batch rather than interactive use, "
"though possibly with an interactive timesharing operating system "
"retrofitted onto it; it is especially used of machines built by IBM, "
"Unisys, and the other great :ref:`dinosaur`\\s surviving from computing's"
" :ref:`Stone-Age`\\."

"It has been common wisdom among hackers since the late 1980s that the "
"mainframe architectural tradition is essentially dead (outside of the "
"tiny market for :ref:`number-crunching` supercomputers having been "
"swamped by the recent huge advances in IC technology and low-cost "
"personal computing. The wave of failures, takeovers, and mergers among "
"traditional mainframe makers in the early 1990s bore this out. The "
"biggest mainframer of all, IBM, was compelled to re-invent itself as a "
"huge systems-consulting house. (See :ref:`dinosaurs-mating` and :ref"
":`killer-micro`\\)."

"However, in yet another instance of the :ref:`cycle-of-reincarnation`\\, "
"the port of Linux to the IBM S/390 architecture in 1999 — assisted by IBM"
" — produced a resurgence of interest in mainframe computing as a way of "
"providing huge quantities of easily maintainable, reliable virtual Linux "
"servers, saving IBM's mainframe division from almost certain extinction."
