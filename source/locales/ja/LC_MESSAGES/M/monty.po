"interface written to perform extremely trivial tasks. An example would be"
" a menu-driven, button clicking, pulldown, pop-up windows program for "
"listing directories. The original monty was an infamous weather-reporting"
" program, Monty the Amazing Weather Man, written at the USGS. Monty had a"

"[Great Britain; commonly capitalized as Monty or as the Full Monty] 16 "
"megabytes of memory, when fitted to an IBM-PC or compatible. A standard "
"PC-compatible using the AT- or ISA-bus with a normal BIOS cannot access "
"more than 16 megabytes of RAM. Generally used of a PC, Unix workstation, "
"etc. to mean fully populated with memory, disk-space or some other "
"desirable resource. See the World Wide Words article `The Full Monty "
"<http://www.worldwidewords.org/articles/monty.htm>`_\\  for discussion of"
" the rather complex etymology that may lie behind this phrase. Compare "
"American :ref:`moby`\\."
