"In source code, some non-obvious constant whose value is significant to "
"the operation of a program and that is inserted inconspicuously in-line ("
" :ref:`hardcoded`\\), rather than expanded in by a symbol set by a "
"commented :code:`#define`\\. Magic numbers in this sense are bad style."

"A number that encodes critical information used in an algorithm in some "
"opaque way. The classic examples of these are the numbers used in hash or"
" CRC functions, or the coefficients in a linear congruential generator "
"for pseudo-random numbers. This sense actually predates and was ancestral"
" to the more common sense"

"Special data located at the beginning of a binary data file to indicate "
"its type to a utility. Under Unix, the system and various applications "
"programs (especially the linker) distinguish between types of executable "
"file by looking for a magic number. Once upon a time, these magic numbers"
" were :ref:`PDP-11` branch instructions that skipped over header data to "
"the start of executable code; 0407, for example, was octal for ‘branch 16"
" bytes relative’. Many other kinds of files now have magic numbers "
"somewhere; some magic numbers are, in fact, strings, like the ``!<arch>``"
" at the beginning of a Unix archive file or the ``%!`` leading PostScript"
" files. Nowadays only a :ref:`wizard` knows the spells to create magic "
"numbers. How do you choose a fresh magic number of your own? Simple — you"
" pick one at random. See? It's magic!"

"An input that leads to a computational boundary condition, where "
"algorithm behavior becomes discontinuous. Numeric overflows (particularly"
" with signed data types) and run-time errors (divide by zero, stack "
"overflows) are indications of magic numbers. The Y2K scare was probably "
"the most notorious magic number non-incident."

"*The* magic number, on the other hand, is ``7±2``\\. See *The magical "
"number seven, plus or minus two: some limits on our capacity for "
"processing information* by George Miller, in the *Psychological Review* "
"63:81-97 (1956). This classic paper established the number of distinct "
"items (such as numeric digits) that humans can hold in short-term memory."
" Among other things, this strongly influenced the interface design of the"
" phone system."
