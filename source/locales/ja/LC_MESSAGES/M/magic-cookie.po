"Something passed between routines or programs that enables the receiver "
"to perform some operation; a capability ticket or opaque identifier. "
"Especially used of small data objects that contain data encoded in a "
"strange or intrinsically machine-dependent way. E.g., on non-Unix OSes "
"with a non-byte-stream model of files, the result of :manpage:`ftell(3)` "
"may be a magic cookie rather than a byte offset; it can be passed to "
":manpage:`fseek(3)`\\, but not operated on in any meaningful way. The "
"phrase it hands you a magic cookie means it returns a result whose "
"contents are not defined but which can be passed back to the same or some"
" other program later."

"An in-band code for changing graphic rendition (e.g., inverse video or "
"underlining) or performing other control functions (see also "
":ref:`cookie`\\). Some older terminals would leave a blank on the screen "
"corresponding to mode-change magic cookies; this was also called a "
":ref:`glitch` (or occasionally a turd; compare :ref:`mouse-droppings`\\)."
" See also :ref:`cookie`\\."
