"An :ref:`email` address that is an alias (or :ref:`macro`\\, though that "
"word is never used in this connection) for many other email addresses. "
"Some mailing lists are simple reflectors, redirecting mail sent to them "
"to the list of recipients. Others are filtered by humans or programs of "
"varying degrees of sophistication; lists filtered by humans are said to "
"be moderated."

"Mailing lists are one of the primary forms of hacker interaction, along "
"with :ref:`Usenet`\\. They predate Usenet, having originated with the "
"first UUCP and ARPANET connections. They are often used for private "
"information-sharing on topics that would be too specialized for or "
"inappropriate to public Usenet groups. Though some of these maintain "
"almost purely technical content (such as the Internet Engineering Task "
"Force mailing list), others (like the ‘sf-lovers’ list maintained for "
"many years by Saul Jaffe) are recreational, and many are purely social. "
"Perhaps the most infamous of the social lists was the eccentric "
":samp:`bandykin` distribution; its latter-day progeny, :samp:`lectroids` "
"and :samp:`tanstaafl`\\, still include a number of the oddest and most "
"interesting people in hackerdom."

"Mailing lists are easy to create and (unlike Usenet) don't tie up a "
"significant amount of machine resources (until they get very large, at "
"which point they can become interesting torture tests for mail software)."
" Thus, they are often created temporarily by working groups, the members "
"of which can then collaborate on a project without ever needing to meet "
"face-to-face. Much of the material in this lexicon was criticized and "
"polished on just such a mailing list (called ‘jargon-friends’), which "
"included all the co-authors of Steele-1983."
