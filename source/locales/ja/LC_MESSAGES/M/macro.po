"[techspeak] A name (possibly followed by a formal :ref:`arg` list) that "
"is equated to a text or symbolic expression to which it is to be expanded"
" (possibly with the substitution of actual arguments) by a macro "
"expander. This definition can be found in any technical dictionary; what "
"those won't tell you is how the hackish connotations of the term have "
"changed over time."

"The term macro originated in early assemblers, which encouraged the use "
"of macros as a structuring and information-hiding device. During the "
"early 1970s, macro assemblers became ubiquitous, and sometimes quite as "
"powerful and expensive as :ref:`HLL`\\s, only to fall from favor as "
"improving compiler technology marginalized assembler programming (see "
":ref:`languages-of-choice`\\). Nowadays the term is most often used in "
"connection with the C preprocessor, LISP, or one of several special-"
"purpose languages built around a macro-expansion facility (such as TeX or"
" Unix's [nt]roff suite)."

"Indeed, the meaning has drifted enough that the collective macros is now "
"sometimes used for code in any special-purpose application control "
"language (whether or not the language is actually translated by text "
"expansion), and for macro-like entities such as the keyboard macros "
"supported in some text editors (and PC TSR or Macintosh INIT/CDEV "
"keyboard enhancers)."
