"The correct, *original* Murphy's Law reads: \"If there are two or more "
"ways to do something, and one of those ways can result in a catastrophe, "
"then someone will do it.\" This is a principle of defensive design, cited"
" here because it is usually given in mutant forms less descriptive of the"
" challenges of design for :ref:`luser`\\s. For example, you don't make a "
"two-pin plug symmetrical and then label it \"THIS WAY UP\"; if it matters"
" which way it is plugged in, then you make the design asymmetrical (see "
"also the anecdote under :ref:`magic-smoke`\\)."

"Edward A. Murphy, Jr. was one of McDonnell-Douglas's test engineers on "
"the rocket-sled experiments that were done by the U.S. Air Force in 1949 "
"to test human acceleration tolerances (USAF project MX981). One "
"experiment involved a set of 16 accelerometers mounted to different parts"
" of the subject's body. There were two ways each sensor could be glued to"
" its mount, and somebody methodically installed all 16 in a replacement "
"set the wrong way around. Murphy then made the original form of his "
"pronouncement, which the test subject (Major John Paul Stapp) mis-quoted "
"(apparently in the more general form \"Whatever can go wrong, will go "
"wrong)\" at a news conference a few days later."

"Within months ‘Murphy's Law’ had spread to various technical cultures "
"connected to aerospace engineering. Before too many years had gone by "
"variants had passed into the popular imagination, changing as they went. "
"Most of these are variants on \"Anything that can go wrong, will\"; this "
"is more correctly referred to as :ref:`Finagles-Law`\\. The memetic drift"
" apparent in these mutants clearly demonstrates Murphy's Law acting on "
"itself!"
