"Commonly used to refer to a :ref:`MUD` player who eats, sleeps, and "
"breathes MUD. Mudheads have been known to fail their degrees, drop out, "
"etc., with the consolation, however, that they made wizard level. When "
"encountered in person, on a MUD, or in a chat system, all a mudhead will "
"talk about is three topics: the tactic, character, or wizard that is "
"supposedly always unfairly stopping him/her from becoming a wizard or "
"beating a favorite MUD; why the specific game he/she has experience with "
"is so much better than any other; and the MUD he or she is writing or "
"going to write because his/her design ideas are so much better than in "
"any existing MUD. See also :ref:`wannabee`\\."

"To the anthropologically literate, this term may recall the Zuni/Hopi "
"legend of the mudheads or *koyemshi*\\, mythical half-formed children of "
"an unnatural union. Figures representing them act as clowns in Zuni "
"sacred ceremonies. Others may recall the ‘High School Madness’ sequence "
"from the Firesign Theatre album *Don't Crush That Dwarf, Hand Me the "
"Pliers*\\, in which there is a character named \"Mudhead\"."
