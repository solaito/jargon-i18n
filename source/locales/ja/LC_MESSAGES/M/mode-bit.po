"[common] A :ref:`flag`\\, usually in hardware, that selects between two "
"(usually quite different) modes of operation. The connotations are "
"different from :ref:`flag` bit in that mode bits are mainly written "
"during a boot or set-up phase, are seldom explicitly read, and seldom "
"change over the lifetime of an ordinary program. The classic example was "
"the EBCDIC-vs.-ASCII bit (#12) of the Program Status Word of the IBM 360."
