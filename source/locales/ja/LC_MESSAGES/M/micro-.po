"A quantifier prefix, calling for multiplication by :math:`10^{-6}` (see "
":ref:`quantifiers`\\). Neither of these uses is peculiar to hackers, but "
"hackers tend to fling them both around rather more freely than is "
"countenanced in standard English. It is recorded, for example, that one "
"CS professor used to characterize the standard length of his lectures as "
"a microcentury — that is, about 52.6 minutes (see also "
":ref:`attoparsec`\\, :ref:`nanoacre`\\, and especially "
":ref:`microfortnight`\\)."

"Personal or human-scale — that is, capable of being maintained or "
"comprehended or manipulated by one human being. This sense is generalized"
" from microcomputer, and is esp. used in contrast with macro- (the "
"corresponding Greek prefix meaning ‘large’)."

"Local as opposed to global (or :ref:`macro-`\\). Thus a hacker might say "
"that buying a smaller car to reduce pollution only solves a microproblem;"
" the macroproblem of getting to work might be better solved by using mass"
" transit, moving to within walking distance, or (best of all) "
"telecommuting."
