"A page from the Unix Programmer's Manual, documenting one of Unix's many "
"commands, system calls, library subroutines, device driver interfaces, "
"file formats, games, macro packages, or maintenance utilities. By "
"extension, the term \"man page\" may be used to refer to documentation of"
" any kind, under any system, though it is most likely to be confined to "
"short on-line references."

"As mentioned in , there is a standard syntax for referring to man page "
"entries: the phrase \"foo(n)\" refers to the page for \"foo\" in chapter "
"n of the manual, where chapter 1 is user commands, chapter 2 is system "
"calls, etc."

"The man page format is beloved, or berated, for having the same sort of "
"pithy utility as the rest of Unix. Man pages tend to be written as very "
"compact, concise descriptions which are complete but not forgiving of the"
" lazy or careless reader. Their stylized format does a good job of "
"summarizing the essentials: invocation syntax, options, basic "
"functionality. While such a concise reference is perfect for the do-one-"
"thing-and-do-it-well tools which are favored by the Unix philosophy, it "
"admittedly breaks down when applied to a command which is itself a major "
"subsystem."
