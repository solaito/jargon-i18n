"[common] A general state, usually used with an adjective describing the "
"state. Use of the word ‘mode’ rather than ‘state’ implies that the state "
"is extended over time, and probably also that some activity "
"characteristic of that state is being carried out. \"No time to hack; I'm"
" in thesis mode.\" In its jargon sense, ‘mode’ is most often attributed "
"to people, though it is sometimes applied to programs and inanimate "
"objects. In particular, see :ref:`hack-mode`\\, :ref:`day-mode`\\, :ref"
":`night-mode`\\, :ref:`demo-mode`\\, :ref:`fireworks-mode`\\, and :ref"
":`yoyo-mode`\\; also :ref:`talk-mode`\\."

"One also often hears the verbs enable and disable used in connection with"
" jargon modes. Thus, for example, a sillier way of saying \"I'm going to "
"crash\" is \"I'm going to enable crash mode now\". One might also hear a "
"request to \"disable flame mode, please\"."

"In a usage much closer to techspeak, a mode is a special state that "
"certain user interfaces must pass into in order to perform certain "
"functions. For example, in order to insert characters into a document in "
"the Unix editor :code:`vi`\\, one must type the \"i\" key, which invokes "
"the \"Insert\" command. The effect of this command is to put vi into "
"\"insert mode\", in which typing the \"i\" key has a quite different "
"effect (to wit, it inserts an \"i\" into the document). One must then hit"
" another special key, \"ESC\", in order to leave \"insert mode\". "
"Nowadays, modeful interfaces are generally considered :ref:`losing` but "
"survive in quite a few widely used tools built in less enlightened times."
