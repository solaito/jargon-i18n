"adj. Large, immense, complex, impressive. \"A Saturn V rocket is a truly "

"n\\. obs. The maximum address space of a machine (see below). For a "
"680[234]0 or :ref:`VAX` or most modern 32-bit architectures, it is "
"4,294,967,296 8-bit bytes (4 gigabytes)."

"A title of address (never of third-person reference), usually used to "

"adj. In backgammon, doubles on the dice, as in moby sixes, moby ones, "
"etc. Compare this with :ref:`bignum` (sense 3): double sixes are both "
"bignums and moby sixes, but moby ones are not bignums (the use of moby to"
" describe double ones is sarcastic). Standard emphatic forms: Moby foo, "
"moby win, moby loss. Foby moo: a spoonerism due to Richard Greenblatt."

"The largest available unit of something which is available in discrete "
"increments. Thus, ordering a \"moby Coke\" at the local fast-food joint "
"is not just a request for a large Coke, it's an explicit request for the "
"largest size they sell."

"This term entered hackerdom with the Fabritek 256K memory added to the "
"MIT AI PDP-6 machine, which was considered unimaginably huge when it was "
"installed in the 1960s (at a time when a more typical memory size for a "
"timesharing system was 72 kilobytes). Thus, a moby is classically 256K "
"36-bit words, the size of a PDP-6 or PDP-10 moby. Back when address "
"registers were narrow the term was more generally useful, because when a "
"computer had virtual memory mapping, it might actually have more physical"
" memory attached to it than any one program could access directly. One "
"could then say \"This computer has 6 mobies\" meaning that the ratio of "
"physical memory to address space is 6, without having to say specifically"
" how much memory there actually is. That in turn implied that the "
"computer could timeshare six ‘full-sized’ programs without having to swap"
" programs between memory and disk."

"Nowadays the low cost of processor logic means that address spaces are "
"usually larger than the most physical memory you can cram onto a machine,"
" so most systems have much *less* than one theoretical ‘native’ moby of "
":ref:`core`\\. Also, more modern memory-management techniques (esp. "
"paging) make the ‘moby count’ less significant. However, there is one "
"series of widely-used chips for which the term could stand to be revived "
"— the Intel 8088 and 80286 with their incredibly :ref:`brain-damaged` "
"segmented-memory designs. On these, a moby would be the 1-megabyte "
"address span of a segment/offset pair (by coincidence, a PDP-10 moby was "
"exactly 1 megabyte of 9-bit bytes)."
