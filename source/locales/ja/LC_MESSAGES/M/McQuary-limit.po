"[from the name of the founder of :samp:`alt.fan.warlord`\\; see "
":ref:`warlording`\\.] 4 lines of at most 80 characters each, sometimes "
"still cited on Usenet as the maximum acceptable size of a :ref:`sig-"
"block`\\. Before the great bandwidth explosion of the early 1990s, long "
"sigs actually cost people running Usenet servers significant amounts of "
"money. Nowadays social pressure against long sigs is intended to avoid "
"waste of human attention rather than machine bandwidth. Accordingly, the "
"McQuary limit should be considered a rule of thumb rather than a hard "
"limit; it's best to avoid sigs that are large, repetitive, and "
"distracting. See also :ref:`warlording`\\."
