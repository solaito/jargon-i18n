"A name used in examples and understood to stand for whatever thing is "
"under discussion, or any random member of a class of things under "
"discussion. The word :ref:`foo` is the :ref:`canonical` example. To avoid"
" confusion, hackers never (well, hardly ever) use ‘foo’ or other words "
"like it as permanent names for anything. In filenames, a common "
"convention is that any filename beginning with a metasyntactic-variable "
"name is a :ref:`scratch` file that may be deleted at any time."

"Metasyntactic variables are so called because (1) they are variables in "
"the metalanguage used to talk about programs etc; (2) they are variables "
"whose values are often variables (as in usages like \"the value of "
"f(foo,bar) is the sum of foo and bar\"). However, it has been plausibly "
"suggested that the real reason for the term \"metasyntactic variable\" is"
" that it sounds good. To some extent, the list of one's preferred "
"metasyntactic variables is a cultural signature. They occur both in "
"series (used for related groups of variables or objects) and as "
"singletons. Here are a few common signatures:"
