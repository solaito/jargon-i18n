"The correct answer to the classic trick question \"Have you stopped "
"beating your wife yet?\". Assuming that you have no wife or you have "
"never beaten your wife, the answer \"yes\" is wrong because it implies "
"that you used to beat your wife and then stopped, but \"no\" is worse "
"because it suggests that you have one and are still beating her. "
"According to various Discordians and Douglas Hofstadter the correct "
"answer is usually \"mu\", a Japanese word alleged to mean \"Your question"
" cannot be answered because it depends on incorrect assumptions\". "
"Hackers tend to be sensitive to logical inadequacies in language, and "
"many have adopted this suggestion with enthusiasm. The word ‘mu’ is "
"actually from Chinese, meaning ‘nothing’; it is used in mainstream "
"Japanese in that sense. In Chinese it can also mean \"have not\" (as in "
"\"I have not done it\"), or \"lack of\", which may or may not be a "
"definite, complete 'nothing'). Native speakers of Japanese do not "
"recognize the Discordian question-denying use, which almost certainly "
"derives from overgeneralization of the answer in the following well-known"
" Rinzai Zen :ref:`koan`\\:"
