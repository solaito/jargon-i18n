"[Usenet: very common] Abbreviation: You Have Been Trolled (see "
":ref:`troll`\\, sense 1). Especially used in \"YHBT. YHL. HAND. \", which"
" is widely understood to expand to \"You Have Been Trolled. You Have "
"Lost. Have A Nice Day\". You are quite likely to see this if you respond "
"incautiously to a flame-provoking post that was obviously floated as "
"sucker bait."
