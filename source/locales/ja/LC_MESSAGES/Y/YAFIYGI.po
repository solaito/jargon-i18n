"[coined in response to WYSIWYG] Describes the command-oriented "
"ed/vi/nroff/TeX style of word processing or other user interface, the "
"opposite of :ref:`WYSIWYG`\\. Stands for \"You asked for it, you got "
"it\", because what you actually asked for is often not apparent until "
"long after it is too late to do anything about it. Used to denote "
"perversity (\"Real Programmers use YAFIYGI tools...and like it!\") or, "
"less often, a necessary tradeoff (\"Only a YAFIYGI tool can have full "
"programmable flexibility in its interface. \")."

"This precise sense of \"You asked for it, you got it\" seems to have "
"first appeared in Ed Post's classic parody *Real Programmers don't use "
"Pascal* (see :ref:`Real-Programmer`\\s); the acronym is a more recent "
"invention."
