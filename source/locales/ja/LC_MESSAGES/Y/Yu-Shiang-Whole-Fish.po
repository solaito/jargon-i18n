"The character gamma (extended SAIL ASCII 0001001), which with a loop in "
"its tail looks like a little fish swimming down the page. The term is "
"actually the name of a Chinese dish in which a fish is cooked whole (not "
":ref:`parse`\\d) and covered with Yu-Shiang (or Yu-Hsiang, or in modern "
"Pinyin transliteration yuxiang) sauce. Usage: primarily by people on the "
"MIT LISP Machine, which could display this character on the screen. Tends"
" to elicit incredulity from people who hear about it second-hand."

"Yu Shiang Whole Fish is alive and well in Unicode as U+0263 LATIN SMALL "
"LETTER GAMMA (as opposed to the actual Greek letter at U+03B3, which "
"usually has a loopless glyph; the form of U+0263 is consistently loopy). "
"This symbol is included in Unicode as a Latin letter because it is used "
"in the International Phonetic Alphabet. In the IPA, gamma represents a "
"voiced velar fricative, the sound commonly transcribed \"gh\" in Arabic "
"or Klingon."
