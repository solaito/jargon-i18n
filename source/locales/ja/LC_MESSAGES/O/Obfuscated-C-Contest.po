"(in full, the ‘International Obfuscated C Code Contest’, or IOCCC) An "
"annual contest run since 1984 over Usenet by Landon Curt Noll and "
"friends. The overall winner is whoever produces the most unreadable, "
"creative, and bizarre (but working) C program; various other prizes are "
"awarded at the judges' whim. C's terse syntax and macro-preprocessor "
"facilities give contestants a lot of maneuvering room. The winning "
"programs often manage to be simultaneously (a) funny, (b) breathtaking "
"works of art, and (c) horrible examples of how *not* to code in C."
