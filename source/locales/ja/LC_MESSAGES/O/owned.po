"[gamers, IRC, crackers] To be dominated, controlled, mastered. For "
"example, if you make a statement completely and utterly false, and "
"someone else corrects it in a way that humiliates or removes you, you are"
" said to \"have been owned\" by that person. When referring to games, \"I"
" own0r UT GOTYE\" means that one has mastered Unreal Tournament, Game of "
"the Year Edition to such a level that even the hardest AI characters are "
"mere lunchmeat, and that no ordinary mortal player would even receive a "
"point in competition. There are several spelling variants: 0wned, "
"0wn0r3d, even pwn0r3d. Hackers do not use this sense."
