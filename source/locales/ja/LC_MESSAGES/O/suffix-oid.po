"Used as in mainstream slang English to indicate a poor imitation, a "
"counterfeit, or some otherwise slightly bogus resemblance. Hackers will "
"happily use it with all sorts of non-Greco/Latin stem words that wouldn't"
" keep company with it in mainstream English. For example, \"He's a "
"nerdoid\" means that he superficially resembles a nerd but can't make the"
" grade; a modemoid might be a 300-baud box (Real Modems run at 28.8 or "
"up); a computeroid might be any :ref:`bitty-box`\\. The word keyboid "
"could be used to describe a :ref:`chiclet-keyboard`\\, but would have to "
"be written; spoken, it would confuse the listener as to the speaker's "
"city of origin."

"More specifically, an indicator for ‘resembling an android’ which in the "
"past has been confined to science-fiction fans and hackers. It too has "
"recently (in 1991) started to go mainstream (most notably in the term "
"‘trendoid’ for victims of terminal hipness). This is probably traceable "
"to the popularization of the term :ref:`droid` in *Star Wars* and its "
"sequels. (See also :ref:`windoid`\\.)"

"Coinages in both forms have been common in science fiction for at least "
"fifty years, and hackers (who are often SF fans) have probably been "
"making ‘-oid’ jargon for almost that long [though GLS and I can "
"personally confirm only that they were already common in the mid-1970s "
"—ESR]."
