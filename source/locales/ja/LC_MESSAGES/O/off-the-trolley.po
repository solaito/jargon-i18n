"This term is much older than computing, and is (uncommon) slang "
"elsewhere. A trolley is the small wheel that trolls, or runs against, the"
" heavy wire that carries the current to run a streetcar. It's at the end "
"of the long pole (the trolley pole) that reaches from the roof of the "
"streetcar to the overhead line. When the trolley stops making contact "
"with the wire (from passing through a switch, going over bumpy track, or "
"whatever), the streetcar comes to a halt, (usually) without crashing. The"
" streetcar is then said to be off the trolley, or off the wire. Later on,"
" trolley came to mean the streetcar itself. Since streetcars became "
"common in the 1890s, the term is more than 100 years old. Nowadays, "
"trolleys are only seen on historic streetcars, since modern streetcars "
"use pantographs to contact the wire."
