"[common; also adj. open-source] Term coined in March 1998 following the "
"Mozilla release to describe software distributed in source under licenses"
" guaranteeing anybody rights to freely use, modify, and redistribute, the"
" code. The intent was to be able to sell the hackers' ways of doing "
"software to industry and the mainstream by avoiding the negative "
"connotations (to :ref:`suit`\\s) of the term \" :ref:`free-software`\\\"."
" For discussion of the follow-on tactics and their consequences, see the "
"`Open Source Initiative <http://www.opensource.org>`_\\  site."

"Five years after this term was invented, in 2003, it is worth noting the "
"huge shift in assumptions it helped bring about, if only because the "
"hacker culture's collective memory of what went before is in some ways "
"blurring. Hackers have so completely refocused themselves around the idea"
" and ideal of open source that we are beginning to forget that we used to"
" do most of our work in closed-source environments. Until the late 1990s "
"open source was a sporadic exception that usually had to live on top of a"
" closed-source operating system and alongside closed-source tools; entire"
" open-source environments like :ref:`Linux` and the \\*BSD systems didn't"
" even exist in a usable form until around 1993 and weren't taken very "
"seriously by anyone but a pioneering few until about five years later."
