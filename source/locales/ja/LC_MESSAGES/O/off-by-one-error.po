"[common] Exceedingly common error induced in many ways, such as by "
"starting at 0 when you should have started at 1 or vice-versa, or by "
"writing :code:`< N` instead of :code:`<= N` or vice-versa. Also applied "
"to giving something to the person next to the one who should have gotten "
"it. Often confounded with :ref:`fencepost-error`\\, which is properly a "
"particular subtype of it."
