"[from mathematics] Mutually independent; well separated; sometimes, "
"irrelevant to. Used in a generalization of its mathematical meaning to "
"describe sets of primitives or capabilities that, like a vector basis in "
"geometry, span the entire ‘capability space’ of the system and are in "
"some sense non-overlapping or mutually independent. For example, in "
"architectures such as the :ref:`PDP-11` or :ref:`VAX` where all or nearly"
" all registers can be used interchangeably in any role with respect to "
"any instruction, the register set is said to be orthogonal. Or, in logic,"
" the set of operators not and or is orthogonal, but the set nand, or, and"
" not is not (because any one of these can be expressed in terms of the "
"others). Also used in comments on human discourse: \"This may be "
"orthogonal to the discussion, but....\""
