"Hackers display an intense tropism towards oriental cuisine, especially "
"Chinese, and especially of the spicier varieties such as Szechuan and "
"Hunan. This phenomenon (which has also been observed in subcultures that "
"overlap heavily with hackerdom, most notably science-fiction fandom) has "
"never been satisfactorily explained, but is sufficiently intense that one"
" can assume the target of a hackish dinner expedition to be the best "
"local Chinese place and be right at least three times out of four. See "
"also :ref:`ravs`\\, :ref:`great-wall`\\, :ref:`stir-fried-random`\\, :ref"
":`laser-chicken`\\, :ref:`Yu-Shiang-Whole-Fish`\\. Thai, Indian, Korean, "
"Burmese, and Vietnamese cuisines are also quite popular."
