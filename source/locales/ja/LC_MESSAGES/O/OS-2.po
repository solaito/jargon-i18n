"The anointed successor to MS-DOS for Intel 286- and 386-based micros; "
"proof that IBM/Microsoft couldn't get it right the second time, either. "
"Often called ‘Half-an-OS’. Mentioning it is usually good for a cheap "
"laugh among hackers — the design was so :ref:`baroque`\\, and the "
"implementation of 1.x so bad, that three years after introduction you "
"could still count the major :ref:`app`\\s shipping for it on the fingers "
"of two hands — in unary. The 2.x versions were said to have improved "
"somewhat, and informed hackers rated them superior to Microsoft Windows "
"(an endorsement which, however, could easily be construed as damning with"
" faint praise). In the mid-1990s IBM put OS/2 on life support, refraining"
" from killing it outright purely for internal political reasons; by 1999 "
"the success of :ref:`Linux` had effectively ended any possibility of a "
"renaissance. See :ref:`monstrosity`\\, :ref:`cretinous`\\, :ref:`second-"
"system-effect`\\."
