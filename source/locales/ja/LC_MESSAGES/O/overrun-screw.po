"[C programming] A variety of :ref:`fandango-on-core` produced by "
"scribbling past the end of an array (C implementations typically have no "
"checks for this error). This is relatively benign and easy to spot if the"
" array is static; if it is auto, the result may be to :ref:`smash-the-"
"stack` â€” often resulting in :ref:`heisenbug`\\s of the most diabolical "
"subtlety. The term overrun screw is used esp. of scribbles beyond the end"
" of arrays allocated with :manpage:`malloc(3)`\\; this typically trashes "
"the allocation header for the next block in the :ref:`arena`\\, producing"
" massive lossage within malloc and often a core dump on the next "
"operation to use :manpage:`stdio(3)` or :manpage:`malloc(3)` itself. See "
":ref:`spam`\\, :ref:`overrun`\\; see also :ref:`memory-leak`\\, :ref"
":`memory-smash`\\, :ref:`aliasing-bug`\\, :ref:`precedence-lossage`\\, "
":ref:`fandango-on-core`\\, :ref:`secondary-damage`\\."
