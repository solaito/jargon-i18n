"In the progression that starts \"On the one hand...\" and continues \"On "
"the other hand...\" mainstream English may add \"on the third hand...\" "
"even though most people don't have three hands. Among hackers, it is just"
" as likely to be \"on the gripping hand\". This metaphor supplied the "
"title of Larry Niven & Jerry Pournelle's 1993 SF novel \"The Gripping "
"Hand\" which involved a species of hostile aliens with three arms (the "
"same species, in fact, referenced in :ref:`juggling-eggs`\\). As with "
":ref:`TANSTAAFL` and :ref:`con_`\\, this usage became one of the "
"naturalized imports from SF fandom frequently observed among hackers."
