"In the multi-player space combat game Netrek, to execute kamikaze attacks"
" against enemy ships which are carrying armies or occupying strategic "
"positions. Named during a game in which one of the players repeatedly "
"used the tactic while playing Orion ship G, showing up in the player list"
" as \"Og\". This trick has been roundly denounced by those who would "
"return to the good old days when the tactic of dogfighting was dominant, "
"but as Sun Tzu wrote, \"What is of supreme importance in war is to attack"
" the enemy's strategy, not his tactics.\" However, the traditional answer"
" to the newbie question \"What does ogg mean?\" is just \"Pick up some "
"armies and I'll show you.\""

"In other games, to forcefully attack an opponent with the expectation "
"that the resources expended will be renewed faster than the opponent will"

"tactic since it has gained a simple name."

" tomorrow.\" \"Whoops! I looked down at the map for a sec and almost "
"ogged that oncoming car.\""
