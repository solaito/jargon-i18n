"[from the Dr. Seuss title *Bartholomew and the Oobleck*\\; the spelling "
"‘oobleck’ is still current in the mainstream] A bizarre semi-liquid "
"sludge made from cornstarch and water. Enjoyed among hackers who make "
"batches during playtime at parties for its amusing and extremely non-"
"Newtonian behavior; it pours and splatters, but resists rapid motion like"
" a solid and will even crack when hit by a hammer. Often found near "
"lasers."

"Some, however, insist that the notion of an ooblick *recipe* is far too "
"mechanical, and that it is best to add the water in small increments so "
"that the various mixed states the cornstarch goes through as it *becomes*"
" ooblick can be grokked in fullness by many hands. For optional "
"ingredients of this experience, see the * Ceremonial Chemicals* section "
"of Appendix B."
