"Hackish take on \"Objective-C\", the name of an object-oriented dialect "
"of C in competition with the better-known C++ (it is used to write native"
" applications on the NeXT machine). Objectionable-C uses a Smalltalk-like"
" syntax, but lacks the flexibility of Smalltalk method calls, and (like "
"many such efforts) comes frustratingly close to attaining the :ref"
":`Right-Thing` without actually doing so."
