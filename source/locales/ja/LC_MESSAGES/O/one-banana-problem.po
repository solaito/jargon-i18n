"At mainframe shops, where the computers have operators for routine "
"administrivia, the programmers and hardware people tend to look down on "
"the operators and claim that a trained monkey could do their job. It is "
"frequently observed that the incentives that would be offered said "
"monkeys can be used as a scale to describe the difficulty of a task. A "
"one-banana problem is simple; hence, \"It's only a one-banana job at the "
"most; what's taking them so long?\" At IBM, folklore divides the world "
"into one-, two-, and three-banana problems. Other cultures have different"
" hierarchies and may divide them more finely; at ICL, for example, five "
"grapes (a bunch) equals a banana. Their upper limit for the in-house "
":ref:`sysape`\\s is said to be two bananas and three grapes (another "
"source claims it's three bananas and one grape, but observes \"However, "
"this is subject to local variations, cosmic rays and ISO\"). At a "
"complication level any higher than that, one asks the manufacturers to "
"send someone around to check things."
