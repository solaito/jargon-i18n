"[techspeak] (Often abbreviated ‘OS’) The foundation software of a "
"machine; that which schedules tasks, allocates storage, and presents a "
"default interface to the user between applications. The facilities an "
"operating system provides and its general design philosophy exert an "
"extremely strong influence on programming style and on the technical "
"cultures that grow up around its host machines. Hacker folklore has been "
"shaped primarily by the :ref:`Unix`\\, :ref:`ITS`\\, :ref:`TOPS-10`\\, "
":ref:`TOPS-20`\\/ :ref:`TWENEX`\\, :ref:`WAITS`\\, :ref:`CP-M`\\, :ref"
":`MS-DOS`\\, and :ref:`Multics` operating systems (most importantly by "
"ITS and Unix). See also :ref:`timesharing`\\."
