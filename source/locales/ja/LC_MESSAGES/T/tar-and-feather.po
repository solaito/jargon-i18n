"[from Unix :manpage:`tar(1)`\\] To create a transportable archive from a "
"group of files by first sticking them together with :manpage:`tar(1)` "
"(the Tape ARchiver) and then compressing the result (see "
":ref:`compress`\\). The latter action is dubbed feathering partly for "
"euphony and (if only for contrived effect) by analogy to what you do with"
" an airplane propeller to decrease wind resistance, or with an oar to "
"reduce water resistance; smaller files, after all, slip through comm "
"links more easily. Compare the more common :ref:`tarball`\\. Earlier, the"
" phrase referred to a punishment in which the victims had tar being "
"poured upon them and then, whilst the tar was still sticky, having a "
"pillow full of feathers - or other material â€” thrown at them. See "
