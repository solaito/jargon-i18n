"Tux the Penguin is the official emblem of :ref:`Linux`\\, This eventuated"
" after a logo contest in 1996, during which Linus Torvalds endorsed the "
"idea of a penguin logo in a couple of famously funny `postings "
"<http://www.sjbaker.org/tux/>`_. Linus explained that he was once bitten "
"by a killer penguin in Australia and has felt a special affinity for the "
"species ever since. (Linus has since admitted that he was also thinking "
"of Feathers McGraw, the evil-genius penguin jewel thief who appeared in a"
" Wallace & Grommit feature cartoon, *The Wrong Trousers*\\.)"

"Larry Ewing `designed <http://www.isc.tamu.edu/~lewing/linux/>`_\\  the "
"official Tux logo. It has proved a wise choice, amenable to hundreds of "
"recognizable variations used as emblems of Linux-related projects, "
"products, and user groups. In fact, Tux has spawned an entire mythology, "
"of which the `Gospel According to Tux "
"<http://www.ao.com/~regan/penguins/tux.html>`_\\  and the mock-epic poem "
"*Tuxowolf* are among the best-known examples."

"There is a ‘real’ Tux — a black-footed penguin resident at the Bristol "
"Zoo. Several friends of Linux bought a zoo sponsorship for Linus as a "
"birthday present in 1996."
