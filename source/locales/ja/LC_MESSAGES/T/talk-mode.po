"A feature supported by Unix and some other OSes that allows two or more "
"logged-in users to set up a real-time on-line conversation. It combines "
"the immediacy of talking with all the precision (and verbosity) that "
"written language entails. It is difficult to communicate inflection, "
"though conventions have arisen for some of these (see the section on "
"writing style in the Prependices for details)."

"Talk mode has a special set of jargon words, used to save typing, which "
"are not used orally. Some of these are identical to (and probably derived"
