"exception is more common among :ref:`HLL` programmers) and appears to be "
"fading into history among programmers as the role of assembler continues "
"to shrink. However, it is still important to computer architects and "
"systems hackers (see :ref:`system`\\, sense 1), who use it to distinguish"
" deterministically repeatable exceptions from timing-dependent ones (such"
" as I/O interrupts)."
