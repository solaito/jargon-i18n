"The Tech Model Railroad Club at MIT, one of the wellsprings of hacker "
"culture. The 1959 *Dictionary of the TMRC Language* compiled by Peter "
"Samson included several terms that became basics of the hackish "
"vocabulary (see esp. :ref:`foo`\\, :ref:`mung`\\, and :ref:`frob`\\)."

"By 1962, TMRC's legendary layout was already a marvel of complexity and "
"has grown in the years since. All the features described here were still "
"present when the old layout was decommissioned in 1998 just before the "
"demolition of MIT Building 20, and will almost certainly be retained when"
" the old layout is rebuilt (expected in 2003). The control system alone "
"featured about 1200 relays. There were :ref:`scram-switch`\\es located at"
" numerous places around the room that could be thwacked if something "
"undesirable was about to occur, such as a train going full-bore at an "
"obstruction. Another feature of the system was a digital clock on the "
"dispatch board, which was itself something of a wonder in those bygone "
"days before cheap LEDs and seven-segment displays. When someone hit a "
"scram switch the clock stopped and the display was replaced with the word"
" ‘FOO’; at TMRC the scram switches are therefore called foo switches."

"Steven Levy, in his book *Hackers* (see the "
":ref:`Bibliography<bibliography>` in Appendix C), gives a stimulating "
"account of those early years. TMRC's Signals and Power Committee included"
" many of the early PDP-1 hackers and the people who later became the core"
" of the MIT AI Lab staff. Thirty years later that connection is still "
"very much alive, and this lexicon accordingly includes a number of "
"entries from a recent revision of the TMRC dictionary."
