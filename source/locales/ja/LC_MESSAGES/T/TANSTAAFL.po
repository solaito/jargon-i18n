"[acronym, from Robert Heinlein's classic SF novel *The Moon is a Harsh "
"Mistress*\\.] \"There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free Lunch\", often "
"invoked when someone is balking at the prospect of using an unpleasantly "
":ref:`heavyweight` technique, or at the poor quality of some piece of "
"software, or at the :ref:`signal-to-noise-ratio` of unmoderated Usenet "
"newsgroups. \"What? Don't tell me I have to implement a database back end"
" to get my address book program to work!\" \"Well, TANSTAAFL you know.\" "
"This phrase owes some of its popularity to the high concentration of "
"science-fiction fans and political libertarians in hackerdom (see "
":ref:`Appendix B<appendixb>` for discussion)."

"Outside hacker circles the variant TINSTAAFL (\"There is No Such "
"Thing...\") is apparently more common, and can be traced back to 1952 in "
"the writings of ethicist Alvin Hansen. TANSTAAFL may well have arisen "
"from it by mutation."
