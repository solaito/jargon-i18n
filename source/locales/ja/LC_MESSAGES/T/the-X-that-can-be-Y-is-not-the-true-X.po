"Yet another instance of hackerdom's peculiar attraction to mystical "
"references â€” a common humorous way of making exclusive statements about a"
" class of things. The template is from the *Tao te Ching*\\: \"The Tao "
"which can be spoken of is not the true Tao.\" The implication is often "
"that the X is a mystery accessible only to the enlightened. See the "
":ref:`trampoline` entry for an example, and compare :ref:`has-"
"the-X-nature`\\."
