"[Usenet, particularly :samp:`rec.arts.sf.written.robert-jordan`\\] "
"Abbrev. of ‘tangent’, as in \"off on a tangent\", and synonym for "
":ref:`OT`\\. A number of hacker-humor synonyms are used for TAN in some "
"newsgroups. Instances such as BEIGE, OFF-WHITE, BROWNISH-GRAY, and LIGHT "
"BROWN have been observed. It is generally understood on newsgroups with "
"this convention that any color descriptor is a TAN synonym if (a) used as"
" the first word(s) of the topic of a Usenet post, (b) written in ALL "
"CAPS, and (c) followed immediately by a colon. Usage: \"OFF-WHITE: 2000 "
"Presidential candidates\" on an SF newsgroup."
