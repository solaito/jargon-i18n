"In hackish lore, refers to the mutated punchline of an age-old joke to be"
" found at the bottom of the manual pages of :manpage:`tunefs(8)` in the "
"original :ref:`BSD` 4.2 distribution. The joke was removed in later "
"releases once commercial sites started using 4.2, but apparently restored"
" on the 4.4BSD tape and in {Net,Free,Open}BSD. Tunefs relates to the "
"tuning of file-system parameters for optimum performance, and at the "
"bottom of a few pages of wizardly inscriptions was a ‘BUGS’ section "
"consisting of the line \"You can tune a file system, but you can't "
"tunafish\". Variants of this can be seen in other BSD versions, though it"
" has been excised from some versions by humorless management "
":ref:`droid`\\s. The [nt]roff source for SunOS 4.1.1 contains a comment "
"apparently designed to prevent this: \"Take this out and a Unix Demon "
"will dog your steps from now until the :code:`time_t`\\'s wrap around.\""
