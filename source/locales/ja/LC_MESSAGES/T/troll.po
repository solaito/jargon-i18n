"v.,n. [From the Usenet group :samp:`alt.folklore.urban`\\] To utter a "
"posting on :ref:`Usenet` designed to attract predictable responses or "
":ref:`flame`\\s; or, the post itself. Derives from the phrase \"trolling "
"for :ref:`newbie`\\s\" which in turn comes from mainstream \"trolling\", "
"a style of fishing in which one trails bait through a likely spot hoping "
"for a bite. The well-constructed troll is a post that induces lots of "
"newbies and flamers to make themselves look even more clueless than they "
"already do, while subtly conveying to the more savvy and experienced that"
" it is in fact a deliberate troll. If you don't fall for the joke, you "
"get to be in on it. See also :ref:`YHBT`\\."

"n\\. An individual who chronically trolls in sense 1; regularly posts "
"specious arguments, flames or personal attacks to a newsgroup, discussion"
" list, or in email for no other purpose than to annoy someone or disrupt "
"a discussion. Trolls are recognizable by the fact that they have no real "
"interest in learning about the topic at hand - they simply want to utter "
"flame bait. Like the ugly creatures they are named after, they exhibit no"
" redeeming characteristics, and as such, they are recognized as a lower "
"form of life on the net, as in, \"Oh, ignore him, he's just a troll.\" "
"Compare :ref:`kook`\\."

"n\\. [Berkeley] Computer lab monitor. A popular campus job for CS "
"students. Duties include helping newbies and ensuring that lab policies "
"are followed. Probably so-called because it involves lurking in dark "
"cavelike corners."

"Some people claim that the troll (sense 1) is properly a narrower "
"category than :ref:`flame-bait`\\, that a troll is categorized by "
"containing some assertion that is wrong but not overtly controversial. "
"See also :ref:`Troll-O-Meter`\\."

"The use of ‘troll’ in any of these senses is a live metaphor that readily"
" produces elaborations and combining forms. For example, one not "
"infrequently sees the warning \"Do not feed the troll\" as part of a "
"followup to troll postings."
