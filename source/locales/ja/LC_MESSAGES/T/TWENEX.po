"The TOPS-20 operating system by :ref:`DEC` — the second proprietary OS "
"for the PDP-10 — preferred by most PDP-10 hackers over TOPS-10 (that is, "
"by those who were not :ref:`ITS` or :ref:`WAITS` partisans). TOPS-20 "
"began in 1969 as Bolt, Beranek & Newman's TENEX operating system using "
"special paging hardware. By the early 1970s, almost all of the systems on"
" the ARPANET ran TENEX. DEC purchased the rights to TENEX from BBN and "
"began work to make it their own. The first in-house code name for the "
"operating system was VIROS (VIRtual memory Operating System); when "
"customers started asking questions, the name was changed to SNARK so DEC "
"could truthfully deny that there was any project called VIROS. When the "
"name SNARK became known, the name was briefly reversed to become KRANS; "
"this was quickly abandoned when someone objected that krans meant "
"‘funeral wreath’ in Swedish (though some Swedish speakers have since said"
" it means simply ‘wreath’; this part of the story may be apocryphal). "
"Ultimately DEC picked TOPS-20 as the name of the operating system, and it"
" was as TOPS-20 that it was marketed. The hacker community, mindful of "
"its origins, quickly dubbed it TWENEX (a contraction of ‘twenty TENEX’), "
"even though by this point very little of the original TENEX code remained"
" (analogously to the differences between AT&T V6 Unix and BSD). DEC "
"people cringed when they heard \"TWENEX\", but the term caught on "
"nevertheless (the written abbreviation ‘20x’ was also used). TWENEX was "
"successful and very popular; in fact, there was a period in the early "
"1980s when it commanded as fervent a culture of partisans as Unix or ITS "
"— but DEC's decision to scrap all the internal rivals to the :ref:`VAX` "
"architecture and its relatively stodgy VMS OS killed the DEC-20 and put a"
" sad end to TWENEX's brief day in the sun. DEC attempted to convince "
"TOPS-20 users to convert to :ref:`VMS`\\, but instead, by the late 1980s,"
" most of the TOPS-20 hackers had migrated to Unix. There is a `TOPS-20 "
"home page <http://panda.com/tops-20/>`_."
