"[German for tar pit] A trap set to punish spammers who use an :ref"
":`address-harvester`\\; a mail server deliberately set up to be really, "
"really slow. To activate it, scatter addresses that look like users on "
"the teergrube's host in places where the address harvester will be "
"trolling (one popular way is to embed the fake address in a Usenet sig "
"block next to a human-readable warning not to send mail to it). The "
"address harvester will dutifully collect the address. When the spammer "
"tries to mailbomb it, his mailer will get stuck."
