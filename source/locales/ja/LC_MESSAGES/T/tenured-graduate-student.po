"One who has been in graduate school for 10 years (the usual maximum is 5 "
"or 6): a ‘ten-yeared’ student (get it?). Actually, this term may be used "
"of any grad student beginning in his seventh year. Students don't really "
"get tenure, of course, the way professors do, but a tenth-year graduate "
"student has probably been around the university longer than any untenured"
" professor."
