"[by analogy with bit] One base-3 digit; the amount of information "
"conveyed by a selection among one of three equally likely outcomes (see "
"also :ref:`bit`\\). Trits arise, for example, in the context of a "
":ref:`flag` that should actually be able to assume *three* values â€” such "
"as yes, no, or unknown. Trits are sometimes jokingly called 3-state bits."
" A trit may be semi-seriously referred to as a bit and a half, although "
"it is linearly equivalent to 1.5849625 bits (that is, log_{2$(3)} bits)."
