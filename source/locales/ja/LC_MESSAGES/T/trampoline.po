"An incredibly :ref:`hairy` technique, found in some :ref:`HLL` and "
"program-overlay implementations (e.g., on the Macintosh), that involves "
"on-the-fly generation of small executable (and, likely as not, self-"
"modifying) code objects to do indirection between code sections. Under "
"BSD and possibly in other Unixes, trampoline code is used to transfer "
"control from the kernel back to user mode when a signal (which has had a "
"handler installed) is sent to a process. These pieces of :ref:`live-data`"
" are called trampolines. Trampolines are notoriously difficult to "
"understand in action; in fact, it is said by those who use this term that"
" the trampoline that doesn't bend your brain is not the true trampoline. "
"See also :ref:`snap`\\."
