"[Unix] The gray eminence of Unix text processing; a formatting and "
"phototypesetting program, written originally in :ref:`PDP-11` assembler "
"and then in barely-structured early C by the late Joseph Ossanna, modeled"
" after the earlier ROFF which was in turn modeled after the "
":ref:`Multics` and :ref:`CTSS` program RUNOFF by Jerome Saltzer (*that* "
"name came from the expression \"to run off a copy\"). A companion "
"program, nroff, formats output for terminals and line printers."

"In 1979, Brian Kernighan modified troff so that it could drive "
"phototypesetters other than the Graphic Systems CAT. His paper describing"
" that work (\"A Typesetter-independent troff,\" AT&T CSTR #97) explains "
"troff's durability. After discussing the program's \"obvious deficiencies"
" — a rebarbative input syntax, mysterious and undocumented properties in "
"some areas, and a voracious appetite for computer resources\" and noting "
"the ugliness and extreme hairiness of the code and internals, Kernighan "

":code:`troff`\\'s relative importance, but this tribute perfectly "
"captures the strengths that secured :code:`troff` a place in hacker "
"folklore; indeed, it could be taken more generally as an indication of "
"those qualities of good programs that, in the long run, hackers most "
"admire."
