"Any confusing acronym. Examples include MCA, FTP, SNA, CPU, MMU, SCCS, "
"DMU, FPU, NNTP, TLA. People who like this looser usage argue that not all"
" TLAs have three letters, just as not all four-letter words have four "
"letters. One also hears of ‘ETLA’ (Extended Three-Letter Acronym, "
"pronounced /ee tee el ay/) being used to describe four-letter acronyms; "
"the terms ‘SFLA’ (Stupid Four-Letter Acronym), ‘LFLA’ (Longer Four Letter"
" Acronym), and VLFLA (Very Long Five Letter Acronym) have also been "
"reported. See also :ref:`YABA`\\."

"The self-effacing phrase \"TDM TLA\" (Too Damn Many...) is often used to "
"bemoan the plethora of TLAs in use. In 1989, a random of the journalistic"
" persuasion asked hacker Paul Boutin \"What do you think will be the "
"biggest problem in computing in the 90s?\" Paul's straight-faced "
"response: \"There are only 17,000 three-letter acronyms.\" (To be exact, "
"there are ``26^3 = 17,576``\\.) There is probably some karmic justice in "
"the fact that Paul Boutin subsequently became a journalist."
