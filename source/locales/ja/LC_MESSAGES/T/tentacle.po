"A covert :ref:`pseudo`\\, sense 1. An artificial identity created in "
"cyberspace for nefarious and deceptive purposes. The implication is that "
"a single person may have multiple tentacles. This term was originally "
"floated in some paranoid ravings on the cypherpunks list (see "
":ref:`cypherpunk`\\), and adopted in a spirit of irony by other, saner "
"members. It has since shown up, used seriously, in the documentation for "
"some remailer software, and is now (1994) widely recognized on the net. "
"Compare :ref:`astroturfing`\\, :ref:`sock-puppet`\\."
