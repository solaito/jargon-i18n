"[originally an acronym for ‘[paper] Tape Editor and COrrector’; later, "
"‘Text Editor and COrrector’] n. A text editor developed at MIT and "
"modified by just about everybody. With all the dialects included, TECO "
"may have been the most prolific editor in use before :ref:`EMACS`\\, to "
"which it was directly ancestral. Noted for its powerful programming-"
"language-like features and its unspeakably :ref:`hairy` syntax. It is "
"literally the case that every string of characters is a valid TECO "
"program (though probably not a useful one); one common game used to be "
"mentally working out what the TECO commands corresponding to human names "
"did."

"In fact, this very program was used to produce the second, sorted list "
"from the first list. The first hack at it had a :ref:`bug`\\: GLS (the "
"author) had accidentally omitted the :code:`\\@` in front of "
":code:`F^B`\\, which as anyone can see is clearly the :ref:`Wrong-"
"Thing`\\. It worked fine the second time. There is no space to describe "
"all the features of TECO, but it may be of interest that :code:`^P` means"
" ‘sort’ and :code:`J<.-Z; ... L>` is an idiomatic series of commands for "
"‘do once for every line’."

"In mid-1991, TECO is pretty much one with the dust of history, having "
"been replaced in the affections of hackerdom by :ref:`EMACS`\\. "
"Descendants of an early (and somewhat lobotomized) version adopted by DEC"
" can still be found lurking on VMS and a couple of crufty :ref:`PDP-11` "
"operating systems, however, and ports of the more advanced MIT versions "
"remain the focus of some antiquarian interest. See also "
":ref:`retrocomputing`\\, :ref:`write-only-language`\\."
