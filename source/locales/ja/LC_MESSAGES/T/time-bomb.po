"A subspecies of :ref:`logic-bomb` that is triggered by reaching some "
"preset time, either once or periodically. There are numerous legends "
"about time bombs set up by programmers in their employers' machines, to "
"go off if the programmer is fired or laid off and is not present to "
"perform the appropriate suppressing action periodically."

"Interestingly, the only such incident for which we have been pointed to "
"documentary evidence took place in the Soviet Union in 1986! A "
"disgruntled programmer at the Volga Automobile Plant (where the Fiat "
"clones called Ladas were manufactured) planted a time bomb which, a week "
"after he'd left on vacation, stopped the entire main assembly line for a "
"day. The case attracted lots of attention in the Soviet Union because it "
"was the first cracking case to make it to court there. The perpetrator "
"got a suspended sentence of 3 years in jail and was barred from future "
"work as a programmer."
