"Term used on GEnie, Usenet and other electronic fora to describe the "
"tendency of a :ref:`thread` to drift away from the original subject of "
"discussion (and thus, from the Subject header of the originating "
"message), or the results of that tendency. The header in each post can be"
" changed to keep current with the posts, but usually isn't due to "
"forgetfulness or laziness. A single post may often result in several "
"posts each responding to a different point in the original. Some "
"subthreads will actually be in response to some off-the-cuff side "
"comment, possibly degenerating into a :ref:`flame-war`\\, or just as "
"often evolving into a separate discussion. Hence, discussions aren't "
"really so much threads as they are trees. Except that they don't really "
"have leaves, or multiple branching roots; usually some lines of "
"discussion will just sort of die off after everyone gets tired of them. "
"This could take anywhere from hours to weeks, or even longer."

"The term ‘topic drift’ is often used in gentle reminders that the "
"discussion has strayed off any useful track. \"I think we started with a "
"question about Niven's last book, but we've ended up discussing the "
"sexual habits of the common marmoset. Now that's topic drift!\""
