"[Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol] The wide-area-"
"networking protocol that makes the Internet work, and the only one most "
"hackers can speak the name of without laughing or retching. Unlike such "
"allegedly ‘standard’ competitors such as X.25, DECnet, and the ISO "
"7-layer stack, TCP/IP evolved primarily by actually being *used*\\, "
"rather than being handed down from on high by a vendor or a heavily-"
"politicized standards committee. Consequently, it (a) works, (b) actually"
" promotes cheap cross-platform connectivity, and (c) annoys the hell out "
"of corporate and governmental empire-builders everywhere. Hackers value "
"all three of these properties. See :ref:`creationism`\\."

"[Amateur Packet Radio] Formerly expanded as \"The Crap Phil Is Pushing\"."
" The reference is to Phil Karn, KA9Q, and the context was an ongoing "
"technical/political war between the majority of sites still running AX.25"
" and the TCP/IP relays. TCP/IP won."
