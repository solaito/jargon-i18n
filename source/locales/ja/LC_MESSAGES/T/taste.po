"The quality in a program that tends to be inversely proportional to the "
"number of features, hacks, and kluges programmed into it. Also tasty, "
"tasteful, tastefulness. \"This feature comes in ``N`` tasty flavors.\" "
"Although tasty and flavorful are essentially synonyms, taste and "
":ref:`flavor` are not. Taste refers to sound judgment on the part of the "
"creator; a program or feature can *exhibit* taste but cannot *have* "
"taste. On the other hand, a feature can have :ref:`flavor`\\. Also, "
":ref:`flavor` has the additional meaning of ‘kind’ or ‘variety’ not "
"shared by taste. The marked sense of :ref:`flavor` is more popular than "
"taste, though both are widely used. See also :ref:`elegant`\\."
