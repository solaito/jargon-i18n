"vt\\. To change something in a small way. Bits, for example, are often "
"twiddled. Twiddling a switch or :ref:`knobs` implies much less sense of "
"purpose than toggling or tweaking it; see :ref:`frobnicate`\\. To speak "
"of twiddling a bit connotes aimlessness, and at best doesn't specify what"
" you're doing to the bit; ‘toggling a bit’ has a more specific meaning "
"(see :ref:`bit-twiddling`\\, :ref:`toggle`\\). 4. Uncommon name for the "
":ref:`twirling-baton` prompt."
