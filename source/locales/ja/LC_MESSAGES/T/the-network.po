"Historically, the union of all the major noncommercial, academic, and "
"hacker-oriented networks, such as Internet, the pre-1990 ARPANET, NSFnet,"
" BITNET, and the virtual UUCP and :ref:`Usenet` ‘networks’, plus the "
"corporate in-house networks and commercial timesharing services (such as "
"CompuServe, GEnie and AOL) that gateway to them. A site is generally "
"considered on the network if it can be reached through some combination "
"of Internet-style (\\@-sign) and UUCP (bang-path) addresses. See "
":ref:`Internet`\\, :ref:`bang-path`\\, :ref:`network-address`\\."

"increasingly synonymous with the Internet itself (as it was before the "
"second wave of wide-area computer networking began around 1980)."

"A fictional conspiracy of libertarian hacker-subversives and anti-"
"authoritarian monkeywrenchers described in Robert Anton Wilson's novel "
"*Schrödinger's Cat*\\, to which many hackers have subsequently decided "
"they belong (this is an example of :ref:`ha-ha-only-serious`\\)."

"In sense 1, the network is often abbreviated to the net. \"Are you on the"
" net?\" is a frequent question when hackers first meet face to face, and "
"\"See you on the net!\" is a frequent goodbye."
