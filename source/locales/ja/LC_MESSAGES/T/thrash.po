"To move wildly or violently, without accomplishing anything useful. "
"Paging or swapping systems that are overloaded waste most of their time "
"moving data into and out of core (rather than performing useful "
"computation) and are therefore said to thrash. Someone who keeps changing"
" his mind (esp. about what to work on next) is said to be thrashing. A "
"person frantically trying to execute too many tasks at once (and not "
"spending enough time on any single task) may also be described as "
"thrashing. Compare :ref:`multitask`\\."
