"An extremely powerful :ref:`macro`\\-based text formatter written by "
"Donald E. :ref:`Knuth`\\, very popular in the computer-science community "
"(it is good enough to have displaced Unix :ref:`troff`\\, the other "
"favored formatter, even at many Unix installations). TeX fans insist on "
"the correct (guttural) pronunciation, and the correct spelling (all caps,"
" squished together, with the E depressed below the baseline; the mixed-"
"case ‘TeX’ is considered an acceptable kluge on ASCII-only devices). Fans"
" like to proliferate names from the word ‘TeX’ — such as TeXnician (TeX "
"user), TeXhacker (TeX programmer), TeXmaster (competent TeX programmer), "
"TeXhax, and TeXnique. See also :ref:`CrApTeX`\\."

"Knuth began TeX because he had become annoyed at the declining quality of"
" the typesetting in volumes I--III of his monumental *Art of Computer "
"Programming* (see :ref:`Knuth`\\, also :ref:`bible`\\). In a "
"manifestation of the typical hackish urge to solve the problem at hand "
"once and for all, he began to design his own typesetting language. He "
"thought he would finish it on his sabbatical in 1978; he was wrong by "
"only about 8 years. The language was finally frozen around 1985, but "
"volume IV of *The Art of Computer Programming* is not expected to appear "
"until 2007. The impact and influence of TeX's design has been such that "
"nobody minds this very much. Many grand hackish projects have started as "
"a bit of :ref:`toolsmith`\\ing on the way to something else; Knuth's "
"diversion was simply on a grander scale than most."

"TeX has also been a noteworthy example of free, shared, but high-quality "
"software. Knuth offers a monetary award to anyone who found and reported "
"bugs dating from before the 1989 code freeze; as the years wore on and "
"the few remaining bugs were fixed (and new ones even harder to find), the"
" bribe went up. Though well-written, TeX is so large (and so full of "
"cutting edge technique) that it is said to have unearthed at least one "
"bug in every Pascal system it has been compiled with."
