"Originally, a team (of :ref:`sneaker`\\s) whose purpose is to penetrate "
"security, and thus test security measures. These people are paid "
"professionals who do hacker-type tricks, e.g., leave cardboard signs "
"saying \"bomb\" in critical defense installations, hand-lettered notes "
"saying \"Your codebooks have been stolen\" (they usually haven't been) "
"inside safes, etc. After a successful penetration, some high-ranking "
"security type shows up the next morning for a ‘security review’ and finds"
" the sign, note, etc., and all hell breaks loose. Serious successes of "
"tiger teams sometimes lead to early retirement for base commanders and "
"security officers (see the :ref:`patch` entry for an example)."

"A subset of tiger teams are professional :ref:`cracker`\\s, testing the "
"security of military computer installations by attempting remote attacks "
"via networks or supposedly ‘secure’ comm channels. Some of their "
"escapades, if declassified, would probably rank among the greatest hacks "
"of all times. The term has been adopted in commercial computer-security "
"circles in this more specific sense."
