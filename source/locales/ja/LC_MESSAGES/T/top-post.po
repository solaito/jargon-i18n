"One major problem with top-posting is that people who do it all too "
"frequently quote the *entire* parent message rather than trimming it down"
" to those portions relevent to their reply â€” this makes threads bulky and"
" unnecessarily difficult to read and arouses the righteous ire of "
"experienced Internet residents (this style is called \"TOFU\" for \"text "
"over, fullquote under\", or sometimes \"jeopardy-style quoting\"). "
"Another problem is that top-posters often word their replies on the "
"assumption that you just read the previous message, even though their "
"perversity has put it further down the page than you have yet read. "
"Oppose :ref:`bottom-post`\\."
