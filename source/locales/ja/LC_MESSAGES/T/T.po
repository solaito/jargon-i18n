"[from LISP terminology for ‘true’] Yes. Used in reply to a question "
"(particularly one asked using :ref:`The -P convention<p-convention>`\\). "
"In LISP, the constant T means ‘true’, among other things. Some Lisp "
"hackers use ‘T’ and ‘NIL’ instead of ‘Yes’ and ‘No’ almost reflexively. "
"This sometimes causes misunderstandings. When a waiter or flight "
"attendant asks whether a hacker wants coffee, he may absently respond "
"‘T’, meaning that he wants coffee; but of course he will be brought a cup"
" of tea instead. Fortunately, most hackers (particularly those who "
"frequent Chinese restaurants) like tea at least as well as coffee — so it"
" is not that big a problem."
