"[ITS] A guest on the system, especially one who generally logs in over a "
"network from a remote location for :ref:`comm-mode`\\, email, games, and "
"other trivial purposes. One step below :ref:`luser`\\. ITS hackers often "
"used to spell this :ref:`turist`\\, perhaps by some sort of tenuous "
"analogy with :ref:`luser` (this usage may also have expressed the ITS "
"culture's penchant for six-letterisms, and/or been some sort of tribute "
"to Alan Turing). Compare :ref:`twink`\\, :ref:`lurker`\\, :ref:`read-"
"only-user`\\."
