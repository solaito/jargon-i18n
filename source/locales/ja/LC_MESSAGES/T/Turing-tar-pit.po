"A place where anything is possible but nothing of interest is practical. "
"Alan Turing helped lay the foundations of computer science by showing "
"that all machines and languages capable of expressing a certain very "
"primitive set of operations are logically equivalent in the kinds of "
"computations they can carry out, and in principle have capabilities that "
"differ only in speed from those of the most powerful and elegantly "
"designed computers. However, no machine or language exactly matching "
"Turing's primitive set has ever been built (other than possibly as a "
"classroom exercise), because it would be horribly slow and far too "
"painful to use. A Turing tar-pit is any computer language or other tool "
"that shares this property. That is, it's theoretically universal â€” but in"
" practice, the harder you struggle to get any real work done, the deeper "
"its inadequacies suck you in. Compare :ref:`bondage-and-discipline-"
"language`\\."
