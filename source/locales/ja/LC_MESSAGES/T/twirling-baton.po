" characters, the baton spins in place. If you output the sequence BS SP "
"between characters, the baton spins from left to right. If you output BS "

"The twirling baton was a popular component of animated signature files on"
" the pioneering PLATO educational timesharing system. The :code:`archie` "
"Internet service is perhaps the best-known baton program today; it uses "
"the twirling baton as an idler indicating that the program is working on "
"a query. The twirling baton is also used as a boot progress indicator on "
"several BSD variants of Unix; if it stops, you're probably going to have "
"a long and trying day."
