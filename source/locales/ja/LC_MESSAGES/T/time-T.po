"An unspecified but usually well-understood time, often used in "
"conjunction with a later time ``T+1``\\. \"We'll meet on campus at time "
"``T`` or at Louie's at time ``T+1``\\\" means, in the context of going "
"out for dinner: \"We can meet on campus and go to Louie's, or we can meet"
" at Louie's itself a bit later.\" (Louie's was a Chinese restaurant in "
"Palo Alto that was a favorite with hackers.) Had the number 30 been used "
"instead of the number 1, it would have implied that the travel time from "
"campus to Louie's is 30 minutes; whatever time ``T`` is (and that hasn't "
"been decided on yet), you can meet half an hour later at Louie's than you"
" could on campus and end up eating at the same time. See also :ref"
":`since-time-T-equals-minus-infinity`\\."
