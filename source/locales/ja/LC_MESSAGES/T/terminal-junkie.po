"[UK] A :ref:`wannabee` or early :ref:`larval-stage` hacker who spends "
"most of his or her time wandering the directory tree and writing "
":ref:`noddy` programs just to get a fix of computer time. Variants "
"include terminal jockey, console junkie, and :ref:`console-jockey`\\. The"
" term console jockey seems to imply more expertise than the other three "
"(possibly because of the exalted status of the :ref:`console` relative to"
" an ordinary terminal). See also :ref:`twink`\\, :ref:`read-only-user`\\."
" Appropriately, this term was used in the works of William S. Burroughs "
"to describe a heroin addict with an unlimited supply."
