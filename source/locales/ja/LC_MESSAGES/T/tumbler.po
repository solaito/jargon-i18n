"[Originally from the Xanadu hypertext project] A tumbler is a :ref"
":`magic-cookie` generated as part of a record or message to give it a "
"unique identity. Usually a tumbler includes an encoded form of its "
"creation date, but if a software system has more than one concurrent "
"process that could generate tumblers it must also include an encoding of "
"the process ID. If tumblers will be shared across multiple network hosts,"
" they must also include the host name or network address. Tumblers often "
"include a hash of the rest of the message or record content so that it is"
" possible to verify the correctness of the data the tumbler is attached "
"to."

"Variant text added to spam instances (often in the Subject line) to make "
"them unique. This kind of tumbler is used to defeat schemes that check an"
" exact hash of an incoming message against known spam signatures; it also"
" compromises some kinds of statistical spam recognition."
