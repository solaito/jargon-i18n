"Scheduler thrashing. This can happen under Unix when you have a number of"
" processes that are waiting on a single event. When that event (a "
"connection to the web server, say) happens, every process which could "
"possibly handle the event is awakened. In the end, only one of those "
"processes will actually be able to do the work, but, in the meantime, all"
" the others wake up and contend for CPU time before being put back to "
"sleep. Thus the system thrashes briefly while a herd of processes "
"thunders through. If this starts to happen many times per second, the "
"performance impact can be significant."
