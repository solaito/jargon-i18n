"A language useful for instructional purposes or as a proof-of-concept for"
" some aspect of computer-science theory, but inadequate for general-"
"purpose programming. :ref:`Bad-Thing`\\s can result when a toy language "
"is promoted as a general purpose solution for programming (see :ref"
":`bondage-and-discipline-language`\\); the classic example is "
":ref:`Pascal`\\. Several moderately well-known formalisms for conceptual "
"tasks such as programming Turing machines also qualify as toy languages "
"in a less negative sense. See also :ref:`MFTL`\\."
