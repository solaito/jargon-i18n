"A collection of tools used to develop for a particular hardware target, "
"or to work with a particular data format (thus ‘the Crusoe development "
"toolchain’, or the ‘DocBook toolchain’). Often used in the context of "
"building software on one system which will be installed or run on some "
"other device; in that case the chain of tools usually consists of such "
"items as a particular version of a compiler, libraries, special headers, "
"etc. May also be used of text-formatting, page layout, or multimedia "
"tools which render from some markup to a variety of production formats. "
"Differs from ‘toolkit’ in that the former implies a collection of semi-"
"independent tools with complementary functions, while ‘toolchain’ implies"
" that each of the parts is a serial stage in a rather tightly bound "
"pipeline. Seems to have become current in early 1999 and 2000; now "
"common."
