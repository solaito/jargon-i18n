"In simulations, the discrete unit of time that passes between iterations "
"of the simulation mechanism. In AI applications, this amount of time is "
"often left unspecified, since the only constraint of interest is the "
"ordering of events. This sort of AI simulation is often pejoratively "
"referred to as tick-tick-tick simulation, especially when the issue of "
"simultaneity of events with long, independent chains of causes is "
":ref:`handwave`\\d."
