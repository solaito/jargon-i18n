"This comes from ‘toggle switches’, such as standard light switches, "
"though the word toggle actually refers to the mechanism that keeps the "
"switch in the position to which it is flipped rather than to the fact "
"that the switch has two positions. There are four things you can do to a "
"bit: set it (force it to be 1), clear (or zero) it, leave it alone, or "
"toggle it. (Mathematically, one would say that there are four distinct "
"boolean-valued functions of one boolean argument, but saying that is much"
" less fun than talking about toggling bits.)"
