"Sex in a computer simulated virtual reality, esp. computer-mediated "
"sexual interaction between the :ref:`VR` presences of two humans. This "
"practice is not yet possible except in the rather limited form of erotic "
"conversation on :ref:`MUD`\\s and the like. The term, however, is widely "
"recognized in the VR community as a :ref:`ha-ha-only-serious` projection "
"of things to come. \"When we can sustain a multi-sensory surround good "
"enough for teledildonics, then we'll know we're getting somewhere.\" See "
"also :ref:`hot-chat`\\."
