"Linguists usually refer to informal language as ‘slang’ and reserve the "
"term ‘jargon’ for the technical vocabularies of various occupations. "
"However, the ancestor of this collection was called the ‘Jargon File’, "
"and hacker slang is traditionally ‘the jargon’. When talking about the "
"jargon there is therefore no convenient way to distinguish it from what a"
" *linguist* would call hackers' jargon — the formal vocabulary they learn"
" from textbooks, technical papers, and manuals."

"To make a confused situation worse, the line between hacker slang and the"
" vocabulary of technical programming and computer science is fuzzy, and "
"shifts over time. Further, this vocabulary is shared with a wider "
"technical culture of programmers, many of whom are not hackers and do not"
" speak or recognize hackish slang."

"The jargon/techspeak distinction is the delicate one. A lot of techspeak "
"originated as jargon, and there is a steady continuing uptake of jargon "
"into techspeak. On the other hand, a lot of jargon arises from "
"overgeneralization of techspeak terms (there is more about this in the "
":ref:`Jargon Construction<construction>` section below)."

#: ../../distinctions.rst:31

"In general, we have considered techspeak any term that communicate "
"primarily by a denotation well established in textbooks, technical "
"dictionaries, or standards documents."

"A few obviously techspeak terms (names of operating systems, languages, "
"or documents) are listed when they are tied to hacker folklore that isn't"
" covered in formal sources, or sometimes to convey critical historical "
"background necessary to understand other entries to which they are cross-"
"referenced. Some other techspeak senses of jargon words are listed in "
"order to make the jargon senses clear; where the text does not specify "
"that a straight technical sense is under discussion, these are marked "
"with ‘[techspeak]’ as an etymology. Some entries have a primary sense "
"marked this way, with subsequent jargon meanings explained in terms of "
"it."

"We have also tried to indicate (where known) the apparent origins of "
"terms. The results are probably the least reliable information in the "
"lexicon, for several reasons. For one thing, it is well known that many "
"hackish usages have been independently reinvented multiple times, even "
"among the more obscure and intricate neologisms. It often seems that the "
"generative processes underlying hackish jargon formation have an internal"
" logic so powerful as to create substantial parallelism across separate "
"cultures and even in different languages! For another, the networks tend "
"to propagate innovations so quickly that ‘first use’ is often impossible "
"to pin down. And, finally, compendia like this one alter what they "
"observe by implicitly stamping cultural approval on terms and widening "
"their use."

"Despite these problems, the organized collection of jargon-related oral "
"history for the new compilations has enabled us to put to rest quite a "
"number of folk etymologies, place credit where credit is due, and "
"illuminate the early history of many important hackerisms such as "
":ref:`kluge`\\, :ref:`cruft`\\, and :ref:`foo`\\. We believe specialist "
"lexicographers will find many of the historical notes more than casually "
"instructive."
