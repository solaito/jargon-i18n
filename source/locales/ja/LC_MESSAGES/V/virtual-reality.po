"A form of network interaction incorporating aspects of role-playing "
"games, interactive theater, improvisational comedy, and ‘true "
"confessions’ magazines. In a virtual reality forum (such as Usenet's "
":samp:`alt.callahans` newsgroup or the :ref:`MUD` experiments on "
"Internet), interaction between the participants is written like a shared "
"novel complete with scenery, foreground characters that may be personae "
"utterly unlike the people who write them, and common background "
"characters manipulable by all parties. The one iron law is that you may "
"not write irreversible changes to a character without the consent of the "
"person who ‘owns’ it. Otherwise anything goes. See :ref:`bamf`\\, "
":ref:`cyberspace`\\, :ref:`teledildonics`\\."
