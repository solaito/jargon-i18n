"A bogus technological prediction or a foredoomed engineering concept, "
"esp. one that fails by implicitly assuming that technologies develop "
"linearly, incrementally, and in isolation from one another when in fact "
"the learning curve tends to be highly nonlinear, revolutions are common, "
"and competition is the rule. The prototype was Vannevar Bush's prediction"
" of ‘electronic brains’ the size of the Empire State Building with a "
"Niagara-Falls-equivalent cooling system for their tubes and relays, a "
"prediction made at a time when the semiconductor effect had already been "
"demonstrated. Other famous vannevars have included magnetic-bubble "
"memory, LISP machines, :ref:`videotex`\\, and a paper from the late 1970s"
" that computed a purported ultimate limit on areal density for ICs that "
"was in fact less than the routine densities of 5 years later."
