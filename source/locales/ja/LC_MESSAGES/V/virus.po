"[from the obvious analogy with biological viruses, via SF] A cracker "
"program that searches out other programs and ‘infects’ them by embedding "
"a copy of itself in them, so that they become :ref:`Trojan-horse`\\s. "
"When these programs are executed, the embedded virus is executed too, "
"thus propagating the ‘infection’. This normally happens invisibly to the "
"user. Unlike a :ref:`worm`\\, a virus cannot infect other computers "
"without assistance. It is propagated by vectors such as humans trading "
"programs with their friends (see :ref:`SEX`\\). The virus may do nothing "
"but propagate itself and then allow the program to run normally. Usually,"
" however, after propagating silently for a while, it starts doing things "
"like writing cute messages on the terminal or playing strange tricks with"
" the display (some viruses include nice :ref:`display-hack`\\s). Many "
"nasty viruses, written by particularly perversely minded "
":ref:`cracker`\\s, do irreversible damage, like nuking all the user's "
"files."

"In the 1990s, viruses became a serious problem, especially among Windows "
"users; the lack of security on these machines enables viruses to spread "
"easily, even infecting the operating system (Unix machines, by contrast, "
"are immune to such attacks). The production of special anti-virus "
"software has become an industry, and a number of exaggerated media "
"reports have caused outbreaks of near hysteria among users; many "
":ref:`luser`\\s tend to blame *everything* that doesn't work as they had "
"expected on virus attacks. Accordingly, this sense of virus has passed "
"not only into techspeak but into also popular usage (where it is often "
"incorrectly used to denote a :ref:`worm` or even a :ref:`Trojan-"
"horse`\\). See :ref:`phage`\\; compare :ref:`back-door`\\; see also :ref"
":`Unix-conspiracy`\\."
