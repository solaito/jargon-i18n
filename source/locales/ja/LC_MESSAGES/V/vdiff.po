"Visual diff. The operation of finding differences between two files by "
":ref:`eyeball-search`\\. The term optical diff has also been reported, "
"and is sometimes more specifically used for the act of superimposing two "
"nearly identical printouts on one another and holding them up to a light "
"to spot differences. Though this method is poor for detecting omissions "
"in the ‘rear’ file, it can also be used with printouts of graphics, a "
"claim few if any diff programs can make. See :ref:`diff`\\."

"An interesting variant of the vdiff technique usable by anyone who has "
"sufficient control over the parallax of their eyeballs (e.g. those who "
"can easily view random-dot stereograms), is to hold up two paper "
"printouts and go cross-eyed to superimpose them. This invokes deep, fast,"
" built-in image comparison wetware (the same machinery responsible for "
"depth perception) and differences stand out almost immediately. This "
"technique is good for finding edits in graphical images, or for comparing"
" an image with a compressed version to spot artifacts."
