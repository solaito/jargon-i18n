"[from Virtual Address eXtension] The most successful minicomputer design "
"in industry history, possibly excepting its immediate ancestor, the "
":ref:`PDP-11`\\. Between its release in 1978 and its eclipse by :ref"
":`killer-micro`\\s after about 1986, the VAX was probably the hacker's "
"favorite machine of them all, esp. after the 1982 release of 4.2 BSD Unix"
" (see :ref:`BSD`\\). Especially noted for its large, assembler-"
"programmer-friendly instruction set — an asset that became a liability "

"A major brand of vacuum cleaner in Britain. Cited here because its sales "
"pitch, \"Nothing sucks like a VAX!\" became a sort of battle-cry of RISC "
"partisans. It is even sometimes claimed that DEC actually entered a "
"cross-licensing deal with the vacuum-Vax people that allowed them to "
"market VAX computers in the U.K. in return for not challenging the vacuum"
" cleaner trademark in the U.S."

"A rival brand actually pioneered the slogan: its original form was "
"\"Nothing sucks like Electrolux\". It has apparently become a classic "
"example (used in advertising textbooks) of the perils of not knowing the "
"local idiom. But in 1996, the press manager of Electrolux AB, while "
"confirming that the company used this slogan in the late 1960s, also "
"tells us that their marketing people were fully aware of the possible "
"double entendre and intended it to gain attention."

"And gain attention it did — the VAX-vacuum-cleaner people thought the "
"slogan a sufficiently good idea to copy it. Several British hackers "
"report that VAX's promotions used it in 1986--1987, and we have one "
"report from a New Zealander that the infamous slogan surfaced there in TV"
" ads for the product in 1992."
