"An electronic service offering people the privilege of paying to read the"
" weather on their television screens instead of having somebody read it "
"to them for free while they brush their teeth. The idea bombed everywhere"
" it wasn't government-subsidized, because by the time videotex was "
"practical the installed base of personal computers could hook up to "
"timesharing services and do the things for which videotex might have been"
" worthwhile better and cheaper. Videotex planners badly overestimated "
"both the appeal of getting information from a computer and the cost of "
"local intelligence at the user's end. Like the :ref:`gorilla-arm` effect,"
" this has been a cautionary tale to hackers ever since. See also "
":ref:`vannevar`\\."
