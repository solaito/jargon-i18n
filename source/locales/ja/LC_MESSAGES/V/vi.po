"[from ‘Visual Interface’] A screen editor crufted together by Bill Joy "
"for an early :ref:`BSD` release; an `interview "
"<http://www.cs.pdx.edu/%7Ekirkenda/joy84.html>`_\\  describing how it "
"came to be is available. Became the *de facto* standard Unix editor and a"
" nearly undisputed hacker favorite outside of MIT until the rise of "
":ref:`EMACS` after about 1984. Tends to frustrate new users no end, as it"
" will neither take commands while expecting input text nor vice versa, "
"and the default setup on older versions provides no indication of which "
"mode the editor is in (years ago, a correspondent reported that he has "
"often heard the editor's name pronounced /vi:l/; there is now a vi clone "
"named vile). Nevertheless vi (and variants such as vim and elvis) is "
"still widely used (about half the respondents in a 1991 Usenet poll "
"preferred it), and even EMACS fans often resort to it as a mail editor "
"and for small editing jobs (mainly because it starts up faster than the "
"bulkier versions of EMACS). See :ref:`holy-wars`\\."
