"Pejorative hackerism for VB.NET (Visual Basic for the .NET framework). "
"VB.NET has been marketed by Microsoft as an updated version of the "
"previous Visual Basic on its .NET framework, but VB.NET is really just C#"
" with a slightly different syntax and fewer libraries. Migrating existing"
" code from Visual Basic to VB.NET is generally impractical because VB.NET"
" has a large number of unnecessary incompatibilities with Visual Basic. "
"Since VB.NET has essentially nothing to do with Visual Basic, a well-"
"known ex-Microserf suggested that VB.NET should have a completely "
"different name â€” Visual Fred. This rapidly caught on."
