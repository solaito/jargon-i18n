"The first widely distributed version of :ref:`Unix`\\, released "
"unsupported by Bell Labs in 1978. The term is used adjectivally to "
"describe Unix features and programs that date from that release, and are "
"thus guaranteed to be present and portable in all Unix versions (this was"
" the standard gauge of portability before the POSIX and IEEE 1003 "
"standards). Note that this usage does *not* derive from the release being"
" the \"seventh version of :ref:`Unix`\\\"; research :ref:`Unix` at Bell "
"Labs has traditionally been numbered according to the edition of the "
"associated documentation. Indeed, only the widely-distributed Sixth and "
"Seventh Editions are widely known as V[67]; the OS that might today be "
"known as ‘V10’ is instead known in full as \"Tenth Edition Research "
"Unix\" or just \"Tenth Edition\" for short. For this reason, \"V7\" is "
"often read by cognoscenti as \"Seventh Edition\". See :ref:`BSD`\\, "
":ref:`Unix`\\. Some old-timers impatient with commercialization and "
"kernel bloat still maintain that V7 was the Last True Unix."
