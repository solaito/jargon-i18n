"(also logical Friday) The last day before an extended weekend, if that "
"day is not a ‘real’ Friday. For example, the U.S. holiday Thanksgiving is"
" always on a Thursday. The next day is often also a holiday or taken as "
"an extra day off, in which case Wednesday of that week is a virtual "
"Friday (and Thursday is a virtual Saturday, as is Friday). There are also"
" virtual Mondays that are actually Tuesdays, after the three-day weekends"
" associated with many national holidays in the U.S."
