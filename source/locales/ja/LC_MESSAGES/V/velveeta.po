"[Usenet: by analogy with :ref:`spam`\\. The trade name Velveeta is "
"attached in the U.S. to a particularly nasty processed-cheese spread.] "
"Also knows as :ref:`ECP`\\; a message that is excessively cross-posted, "
"as opposed to :ref:`spam` which is too frequently posted. This term is "
"widely recognized but not commonly used; most people refer to both kinds "
"of abuse as spam. Compare :ref:`jello`\\."
