"[from the old *Star Trek* TV series via Commodore Amiga hackers] The "
"keyboard combination that forces a soft-boot or jump to ROM monitor (on "
"machines that support such a feature). On Amigas this is <Ctrl>-<Left-"
"Amiga>-<Right-Amiga>; on PC clones this is Ctrl-Alt-Del; on Suns, L1-A; "
"on Macintoshes, it is <Cmd>-<Power switch> or <Cmd>-<Ctrl>-<Power>! On "
"IRIX, <Left-Ctrl><Left-Shift><F12><Keypad-Slash>, which kills and "
"restarts the X server, is sometimes called a vulcan nerve pinch. Also "
"called :ref:`three-finger-salute` and Vulcan death grip. At shops with a "
"lot of Microsoft Windows machines, this is often called the Microsoft "
"Maneuver because of the distressing frequency with which Microsoft's "
"unreliable software requires it. Compare :ref:`quadruple-bucky`\\."
