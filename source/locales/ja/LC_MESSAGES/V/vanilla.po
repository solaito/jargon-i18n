"[from the default flavor of ice cream in the U.S.] Ordinary "
":ref:`flavor`\\, standard. When used of food, very often does not mean "
"that the food is flavored with vanilla extract! For example, vanilla "
"wonton soup means ordinary wonton soup, as opposed to hot-and-sour wonton"
" soup. Applied to hardware and software, as in \"Vanilla Version 7 Unix "
"can't run on a vanilla 11/34.\" Also used to orthogonalize chip "
"nomenclature; for instance, a 74V00 means what TI calls a 7400, as "
"distinct from a 74LS00, etc. This word differs from :ref:`canonical` in "
"that the latter means ‘default’, whereas vanilla simply means ‘ordinary’."
" For example, when hackers go on a :ref:`great-wall`\\, hot-and-sour soup"
" is the :ref:`canonical` soup to get (because that is what most of them "
"usually order) even though it isn't the vanilla (wonton) soup."
