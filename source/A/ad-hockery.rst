/ad·hok'\@r·ee/, n\.

[Purdue]

1.
   Gratuitous assumptions made inside certain programs, esp.
   expert systems, which lead to the appearance of semi-intelligent behavior but are in fact entirely arbitrary.
   For example, fuzzy-matching of input tokens that might be typing errors against a symbol table can make it look as though a program knows how to spell.

2.
   Special-case code to cope with some awkward input that would otherwise cause a program to :ref:`choke`\, presuming normal inputs are dealt with in some cleaner and more regular way.

Also called ad-hackery, ad-hocity (/ad-hos'\@-tee/), ad-crockery.
See also :ref:`ELIZA-effect`\.
