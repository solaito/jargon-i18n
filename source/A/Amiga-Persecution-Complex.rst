Amiga Persecution Complex
============================================================

n\.

The disorder suffered by a particularly egregious variety of :ref:`bigot`\, those who believe that the marginality of their preferred machine is the result of some kind of industry-wide conspiracy (for without a conspiracy of some kind, the eminent superiority of their beloved shining jewel of a platform would obviously win over all, market pressures be damned!)
Those afflicted are prone to engaging in :ref:`flame-war`\s and calling for boycotts and mailbombings.
Amiga Persecution Complex is by no means limited to Amiga users; NeXT, :ref:`NeWS`\, :ref:`OS-2`\, Macintosh, :ref:`LISP`\, and :ref:`GNU` users are also common victims.
:ref:`Linux` users used to display symptoms very frequently before Linux started winning; some still do.
