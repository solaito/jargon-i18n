anti-idiotarianism
============================================================

n\.

[very common] Opposition to idiots of all political stripes.
First coined in the :ref:`blog` named `Little Green Footballs <http://www.littlegreenfootballs.com/weblog/weblog.php>`_\  as part of a post expressing disgust with inane responses to post-9/11 Islamic terrorism.
Anti-idiotarian wrath has focused on Islamic terrorists and their sympathizers in the Western political left, but also routinely excoriated right-wing politicians backing repressive ’anti-terror‘ legislation and Christian religious figures who (in the blogosphere's view of the matter) have descended nearly to the level of jihad themselves.
