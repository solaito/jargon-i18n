n\.

About an inch.*atto-* is the standard SI prefix for multiplication by :math:`10^{-18}`\.
A parsec (parallax-second) is 3.26 light-years; an attoparsec is thus :math:`3.26 Ã— 10^{-18}` light years, or about 3.1 cm (thus, 1 attoparsec/ :ref:`microfortnight` equals about 1 inch/sec).
This unit is reported to be in use (though probably not very seriously) among hackers in the U.K. See :ref:`micro-`\.
