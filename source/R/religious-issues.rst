religious issues
============================================================

n\.

Questions which seemingly cannot be raised without touching off :ref:`holy-wars`\, such as "What is the best operating system (or editor, language, architecture, shell, mail reader, news reader)?
", "What about that Heinlein guy, eh?
", "What should we add to the new Jargon File?"
See :ref:`holy-wars`\; see also :ref:`theology`\, :ref:`bigot`\, and compare :ref:`rathole`\.

This term is a prime example of :ref:`ha-ha-only-serious`\.
People actually develop the most amazing and religiously intense attachments to their tools, even when the tools are intangible.
The most constructive thing one can do when one stumbles into the crossfire is mumble :ref:`Get-a-life-` and leave â€” unless, of course, one's *own* unassailably rational and obviously correct choices are being slammed.
