pl\.n\.

1.
   Anything that requires :ref:`heavy-wizardry` or :ref:`black-art` to :ref:`parse`\: core dumps, JCL commands, APL, or code in a language you haven't a clue how to read.
   Not quite as bad as :ref:`line-noise`\, but close.
   Compare :ref:`casting-the-runes`\, :ref:`Great-Runes`\.

2.
   Special display characters (for example, the high-half graphics on an IBM PC).

3.
   [borderline techspeak] 16-bit characters from the Unicode multilingual character set.
