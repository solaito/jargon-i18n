replicator
============================================================

n\.

Any construct that acts to produce copies of itself; this could be a living organism, an idea (see :ref:`meme`\), a program (see :ref:`quine`\, :ref:`worm`\, :ref:`wabbit`\, :ref:`fork-bomb`\, and :ref:`virus`\), a pattern in a cellular automaton (see :ref:`life`\, sense 1), or (speculatively) a robot or :ref:`nanobot`\.
It is even claimed by some that :ref:`Unix` and :ref:`C` are the symbiotic halves of an extremely successful replicator; see :ref:`Unix-conspiracy`\.
