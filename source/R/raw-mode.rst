.. _raw-mode:

============================================================
raw mode
============================================================

n\.

A mode that allows a program to transfer bits directly to or from an I/O device (or, under :ref:`bogus` operating systems that make a distinction, a disk file) without any processing, abstraction, or interpretation by the operating system.
Compare :ref:`rare-mode`\, :ref:`cooked-mode`\.
This is techspeak under Unix, jargon elsewhere.
