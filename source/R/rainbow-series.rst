rainbow series
============================================================

n\.

Any of several series of technical manuals distinguished by cover color.
The original rainbow series was the NCSC security manuals (see :ref:`Orange-Book`\).
These are now available `via the web <http://www.radium.ncsc.mil/tpep/library/rainbow/>`_.
the term has also been commonly applied to the PostScript reference set.
Which books are meant by "the rainbow series" unqualified is thus dependent on one's local technical culture.
