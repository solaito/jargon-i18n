vt\.

[Bell Labs] To destroy, esp.
of a data structure.
Hardware gets :ref:`toast`\ed or :ref:`fried`\, software gets roached.
Probably derived from '70s and '80s drug slang; marijuana smokers used ‘roach’ to refer to the unsmokable remnant of a joint, and to ‘roach’ a joint was therefore to destroy it.
