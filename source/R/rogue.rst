1.
   [Unix] n. A Dungeons-and-Dragons-like game using character graphics, written under BSD Unix and subsequently ported to other Unix systems.
   The original BSD :manpage:`curses(3)` screen-handling package was hacked together by Ken Arnold primarily to support games, and the development of :manpage:`rogue(6)` popularized its use; it has since become one of Unix's most important and heavily used application libraries.
   Nethack, Omega, Larn, Angband, and an entire subgenre of computer dungeon games (all known as ‘roguelikes’) all took off from the inspiration provided by :manpage:`rogue(6)`\; the popular Windows game Diablo, though graphics-intensive, has very similar play logic.
   See also :ref:`nethack`\, :ref:`moria`\, :ref:`Angband`\.

2.
   [Usenet] adj.
   An :ref:`ISP` which permits net abuse (usually in the form of :ref:`spam`\ming) by its customers, or which itself engages in such activities.
   Rogue ISPs are sometimes subject to :ref:`IDP`\s or :ref:`UDP`\s.
   Sometimes deliberately misspelled as "rouge".
