retrocomputing

/ret'·roh·k\@m·pyoo´ting/, n\.

Refers to emulations of way-behind-the-state-of-the-art hardware or software, or implementations of never-was-state-of-the-art; esp.
if such implementations are elaborate practical jokes and/or parodies, written mostly for :ref:`hack-value`\, of more ‘serious’ designs.
Perhaps the most widely distributed retrocomputing utility was the :manpage:`pnch(6)` or :manpage:`bcd(6)` program on V7 and other early Unix versions, which would accept up to 80 characters of text argument and display the corresponding pattern in :ref:`punched-card` code.
Other well-known retrocomputing hacks have included the programming language :ref:`INTERCAL`\, a :ref:`JCL`\-emulating shell for Unix, the card-punch-emulating editor named 029, and various elaborate :ref:`PDP-11` hardware emulators and RT-11 OS emulators written just to keep an old, sourceless :ref:`Zork` binary running.

A tasty selection of retrocomputing programs are made available at the Retrocomputing Museum, `http://www.catb.org/retro/ <http://www.catb.org/retro/>`_.
