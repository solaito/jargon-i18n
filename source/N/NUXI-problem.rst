NUXI problem
============================================================

/nuk´see pro´bl\@m/, n\.

Refers to the problem of transferring data between machines with differing byte-order.
The string "UNIX" might look like "NUXI" on a machine with a different byte sex (e.g., when transferring data from a :ref:`little-endian` to a :ref:`big-endian`\, or vice-versa).
See also :ref:`middle-endian`\, :ref:`swab`\, and :ref:`bytesexual`\.
