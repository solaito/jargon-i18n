.. _NMI:

============================================================
NMI
============================================================

/N·M·I/, n\.

Non-Maskable Interrupt.
An IRQ 7 on the :ref:`PDP-11` or 680[01234]0; the NMI line on an 80[1234]86.
In contrast with a :ref:`priority-interrupt` (which might be ignored, although that is unlikely), an NMI is *never* ignored.
Except, that is, on :ref:`clone` boxes, where NMI is often ignored on the motherboard because flaky hardware can generate many spurious ones.
