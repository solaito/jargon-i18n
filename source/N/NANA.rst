[Usenet] The newsgroups news.admin.net-abuse.\*, devoted to fighting :ref:`spam` and network abuse.
Each individual newsgroup is often referred to by adding a letter to NANA.
For example, NANAU would refer to :samp:`news.admin.net-abuse.usenet`\.

When spam began to be a serious problem around 1995, and a loose network of anti-spammers formed to combat it, spammers immediately accused them of being the :ref:`backbone-cabal`\, or the Cabal reborn.
Though this was not true, spam-fighters ironically accepted the label and the tag line "There is No Cabal" reappeared (later, and now commonly, abbreviated to "TINC").
Nowadays "the Cabal" is generally understood to refer to the NANA regulars.
