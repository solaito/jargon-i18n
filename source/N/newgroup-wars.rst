[Usenet] The salvos of dueling :code:`newgroup` and :code:`rmgroup` messages sometimes exchanged by persons on opposite sides of a dispute over whether a :ref:`newsgroup` should be created net-wide, or (even more frequently) whether an obsolete one should be removed.
These usually settle out within a week or two as it becomes clear whether the group has a natural constituency (usually, it doesn't).
At times, especially in the completely anarchic :samp:`alt` hierarchy, the names of newsgroups themselves become a form of comment or humor; e.g., the group :samp:`alt.swedish.chef.bork.bork.bork` which originated as a birthday joke for a Muppets fan, or any number of specialized abuse groups named after particularly notorious :ref:`flamer`\s, e.g., :samp:`alt.weemba`\.
