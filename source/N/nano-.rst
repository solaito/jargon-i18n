pref\.

[SI: the next quantifier below :ref:`micro-`\; meaning :math:`Ã— 10^{-9}`\] Smaller than :ref:`micro-`\, and used in the same rather loose and connotative way.
Thus, one has :ref:`nanotechnology` (coined by hacker K. Eric Drexler) by analogy with microtechnology; and a few machine architectures have a nanocode level below microcode.
Tom Duff at Bell Labs has also pointed out that "Pi seconds is a nanocentury".
