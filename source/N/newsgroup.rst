============================================================

n\.

[Usenet] One of :ref:`Usenet`\'s huge collection of topic groups or :ref:`fora`\.
Usenet groups can be unmoderated (anyone can post) or moderated (submissions are automatically directed to a moderator, who edits or filters and then posts the results).
Some newsgroups have parallel :ref:`mailing-list`\s for Internet people with no netnews access, with postings to the group automatically propagated to the list and vice versa.
Some moderated groups (especially those which are actually gatewayed Internet mailing lists) are distributed as digests, with groups of postings periodically collected into a single large posting with an index.

Among the best-known are :samp:`comp.lang.c` (the C-language forum), :samp:`comp.arch` (on computer architectures), :samp:`comp.unix.wizards` (for Unix wizards), :samp:`rec.arts.sf.written` and siblings (for science-fiction fans), and :samp:`talk.politics.misc` (miscellaneous political discussions and :ref:`flamage`\).
