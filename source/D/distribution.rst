n\.

1.
   A software source tree packaged for distribution; but see :ref:`kit`\.
   Since about 1996 unqualified use of this term often implies ‘ :ref:`Linux` distribution’.
   The short form :ref:`distro` is often used for this sense.

2.
   A vague term encompassing mailing lists and Usenet newsgroups (but not :ref:`BBS` :ref:`fora`\); any topic-oriented message channel with multiple recipients.

3.
   An information-space domain (usually loosely correlated with geography) to which propagation of a Usenet message is restricted; a much-underutilized feature.
