/dis·kor´di·\@n·ism/, n\.

The veneration of :ref:`Eris`\, a.k.a.
Discordia; widely popular among hackers.
Discordianism was popularized by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson's novel *Illuminatus!* as a sort of self-subverting Dada-Zen for Westerners — it should on no account be taken seriously but is far more serious than most jokes.
Consider, for example, the Fifth Commandment of the Pentabarf, from *Principia Discordia*\: "A Discordian is Prohibited of Believing What he Reads."
Discordianism is usually connected with an elaborate conspiracy theory/joke involving millennia-long warfare between the anarcho-surrealist partisans of Eris and a malevolent, authoritarian secret society called the Illuminati.
