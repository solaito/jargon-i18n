n\.

The multiple kilograms of macerated, pounded, steamed, bleached, and pressed trees that accompany most modern software or hardware products (see also :ref:`tree-killer`\).
Hackers seldom read paper documentation and (too) often resist writing it; they prefer theirs to be terse and on-line.
A common comment on this predilection is "You can't :ref:`grep` dead trees".
See :ref:`drool-proof-paper`\, :ref:`verbiage`\, :ref:`treeware`\.
