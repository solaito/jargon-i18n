disk farm
============================================================

n\.

A large room or rooms filled with disk drives (esp.
:ref:`washing-machine`\s).
This term was well established by 1990, and generalized by about ten years later; see :ref:`farm`\.
It has become less common as disk strange densities reached livels where terabytes of storage can easily be fit in a single rack.
