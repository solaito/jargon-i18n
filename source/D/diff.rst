   Compare :ref:`vdiff`\.

2.
   Specifically, such a listing produced by the :manpage:`diff(1)` command, esp.
   when used as specification input to the :manpage:`patch(1)` utility (which can actually perform the modifications; see :ref:`patch`\).
   This is a common method of distributing patches and source updates in the Unix/C world.

3. v\.
   To compare (whether or not by use of automated tools on machine-readable files); see also :ref:`vdiff`\, :ref:`mod`\.
