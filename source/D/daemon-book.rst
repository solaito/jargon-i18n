*The Design and Implementation of the 4.3BSD UNIX Operating System*\, by Samuel J. Leffler, Marshall Kirk McKusick, Michael J. Karels, and John S. Quarterman (Addison-Wesley Publishers, 1989, ISBN 0-201-06196-1); or *The Design and Implementation of the 4.4 BSD Operating System* by Marshall Kirk McKusick, Keith Bostic, Michael J. Karels and John S. Quarterman (Addison-Wesley Longman, 1996, ISBN 0-201-54979-4) Either of the standard reference books on the internals of :ref:`BSD` Unix.
So called because the covers have a picture depicting a little demon (a visual play on :ref:`daemon`\) in sneakers, holding a pitchfork (referring to one of the characteristic features of Unix, the :manpage:`fork(2)` system call).
