dumb terminal
============================================================

n\.

A terminal that is one step above a :ref:`glass-tty`\, having a minimally addressable cursor but no on-screen editing or other features normally supported by a :ref:`smart-terminal`\.
Once upon a time, when glass ttys were common and addressable cursors were something special, what is now called a dumb terminal could pass for a smart terminal.
