Dr. Fred Mbogo

/\@m·boh´goh, dok´tr fred/, n\.

[Stanford] The archetypal man you don't want to see about a problem, esp.
an incompetent professional; a shyster.
"Do you know a good eye doctor?"
"Sure, try Mbogo Eye Care and Professional Dry Cleaning."
The name comes from synergy between :ref:`bogus` and the original Dr. Mbogo, a witch doctor who was Gomez Addams' physician on the old *Addams Family* TV show.
Interestingly enough, it turns out that under the rules for Swahili noun classes, ‘m-’ is the characteristic prefix of "nouns referring to human beings".
As such, "mbogo" is quite plausible as a Swahili coinage for a person having the nature of a :ref:`bogon`\.
Actually, "mbogo" is indeed a Ki-Swahili word referring to the African Cape Buffalo, *syncerus caffer*\.
It is one of the "big five" dangerous African game animals, and many people with bush experience believe it to be the most dangerous of them.
