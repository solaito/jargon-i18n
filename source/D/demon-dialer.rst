demon dialer
============================================================

n\.

A program which repeatedly calls the same telephone number.
Demon dialing may be benign (as when a number of communications programs contend for legitimate access to a :ref:`BBS` line) or malign (that is, used as a prank or denial-of-service attack).
This term dates from the :ref:`blue-box` days of the 1970s and early 1980s and is now semi-obsolescent among :ref:`phreaker`\s; see :ref:`war-dialer` for its contemporary progeny.
