/day\`t\@·may´sh\@n/, n\.

A magazine that many hackers assume all :ref:`suit`\s read.
Used to question an unbelieved quote, as in "Did you read that in *Datamation?*\".
It used to publish something hackishly funny every once in a while, like the original paper on :ref:`COME-FROM` in 1973, and Ed Post's *Real Programmers Don't Use Pascal* ten years later, but for a long time after that it was much more exclusively :ref:`suit`\-oriented and boring.
Following a change of editorship in 1994, Datamation briefly tried for more the technical content and irreverent humor that marked its early days, but this did not last.
