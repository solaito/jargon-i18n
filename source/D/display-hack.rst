display hack
============================================================

n\.

A program with the same approximate purpose as a kaleidoscope: to make pretty pictures.
Famous display hacks include :ref:`munching-squares`\, :ref:`smoking-clover`\, the BSD Unix :manpage:`rain(6)` program, :manpage:`worms(6)` on miscellaneous Unixes, and the :ref:`X` :manpage:`kaleid(1)` program.
Display hacks can also be implemented by creating text files containing numerous escape sequences for interpretation by a video terminal; one notable example displayed, on any VT100, a Christmas tree with twinkling lights and a toy train circling its base.
The :ref:`hack-value` of a display hack is proportional to the esthetic value of the images times the cleverness of the algorithm divided by the size of the code.
Syn.
:ref:`psychedelicware`\.
