doubled sig
============================================================

n\.

A :ref:`sig-block` that has been included twice in a :ref:`Usenet` article or, less commonly, in an electronic mail message.
An article or message with a doubled sig can be caused by improperly configured software.
More often, however, it reveals the author's lack of experience in electronic communication.
See :ref:`B1FF`\, :ref:`pseudo`\.
