/drek´net/, n\.

[from Yiddish/German ‘dreck’, meaning filth] Deliberate distortion of DECNET, a networking protocol used in the :ref:`VMS` community.
So called because :ref:`DEC` helped write the Ethernet specification and then (either stupidly or as a malignant customer-control tactic) violated that spec in the design of DRECNET in a way that made it incompatible.
See also :ref:`connector-conspiracy`\.
