point-and-drool interface
============================================================

n\.

Parody of the techspeak term point-and-click interface, describing a windows, icons, and mouse-based interface such as is found on the Macintosh.
The implication, of course, is that such an interface is only suitable for idiots.
See :ref:`for-the-rest-of-us`\, :ref:`WIMP-environment`\, :ref:`Macintrash`\, :ref:`drool-proof-paper`\.
Also point-and-grunt interface.
