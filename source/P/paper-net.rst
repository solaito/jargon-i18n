Hackish way of referring to the postal service, analogizing it to a very slow, low-reliability network.
Usenet :ref:`sig-block`\s sometimes include a "Paper-Net:" header just before the sender's postal address; common variants of this are "Papernet" and "P-Net".
Note that the standard :ref:`netiquette` guidelines discourage this practice as a waste of bandwidth, since netters are quite unlikely to casually use postal addresses.
Compare :ref:`voice-net`\, :ref:`snail-mail`\.
