[Programmed Data Processor model 10] The machine that made :ref:`timesharing` real.
It looms large in hacker folklore because of its adoption in the mid-1970s by many university computing facilities and research labs, including the MIT AI Lab, Stanford, and CMU.
Some aspects of the instruction set (most notably the bit-field instructions) are still considered unsurpassed.
The 10 was eventually eclipsed by the :ref:`VAX` machines (descendants of the :ref:`PDP-11`\) when :ref:`DEC` recognized that the 10 and :ref:`VAX` product lines were competing with each other and decided to concentrate its software development effort on the more profitable :ref:`VAX`\.
The machine was finally dropped from DEC's line in 1983, following the failure of the Jupiter Project at DEC to build a viable new model.
(Some attempts by other companies to market clones came to nothing; see :ref:`Foonly` and :ref:`Mars`\.)
This event spelled the doom of :ref:`ITS` and the technical cultures that had spawned the original Jargon File, but by mid-1991 it had become something of a badge of honorable old-timerhood among hackers to have cut one's teeth on a PDP-10.
