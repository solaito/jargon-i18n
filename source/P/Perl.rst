[Practical Extraction and Report Language, a.k.a.
Pathologically Eclectic Rubbish Lister] An interpreted language developed by Larry Wall, author of :manpage:`patch(1)` and :manpage:`rn(1)`\).
Superficially resembles :ref:`awk`\, but is much hairier, including many facilities reminiscent of :manpage:`sed(1)` and shells and a comprehensive Unix system-call interface.
Unix sysadmins, who are almost always incorrigible hackers, generally consider it one of the :ref:`languages-of-choice`\, and it is by far the most widely used tool for making ‘live’ web pages via CGI.
Perl has been described, in a parody of a famous remark about :manpage:`lex(1)`\, as the :ref:`Swiss-Army-chainsaw` of Unix programming.
Though Perl is very useful, it would be a stretch to describe it as pretty or :ref:`elegant`\; people who like clean, spare design generally prefer :ref:`Python`\.
