padded cell

n\.

Where you put :ref:`luser`\s so they can't hurt anything.
A program that limits a luser to a carefully restricted subset of the capabilities of the host system (for example, the :manpage:`rsh(1)` utility on USG Unix).
Note that this is different from an :ref:`iron-box` because it is overt and not aimed at enforcing security so much as protecting others (and the luser) from the consequences of the luser's boundless naivete (see :ref:`naive`\).
Also padded cell environment.
