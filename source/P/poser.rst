n\.

[from French *poseur*\] A :ref:`wannabee`\; not hacker slang, but used among crackers, phreaks and :ref:`warez-d00dz`\.
Not as negative as :ref:`lamer` or :ref:`leech`\.
Probably derives from a similar usage among punk-rockers and metalheads, putting down those who "talk the talk but don't walk the walk".
