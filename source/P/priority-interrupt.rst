n\.

[from the hardware term] Describes any stimulus compelling enough to yank one right out of :ref:`hack-mode`\.
Classically used to describe being dragged away by an :ref:`SO` for immediate sex, but may also refer to more mundane interruptions such as a fire alarm going off in the near vicinity.
Also called an :ref:`NMI` (non-maskable interrupt), especially in PC-land.
