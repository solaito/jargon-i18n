[Usenet: truncation of ‘pseudonym’]

1.
   An electronic-mail or :ref:`Usenet` persona adopted by a human for amusement value or as a means of avoiding negative repercussions of one's net.behavior; a ‘nom de Usenet’, often associated with forged postings designed to conceal message origins.
   Perhaps the best-known and funniest hoax of this type is :ref:`B1FF`\.
   See also :ref:`tentacle`\.

2.
   Notionally, a :ref:`flamage`\-generating AI program simulating a Usenet user.
   Many flamers have been accused of actually being such entities, despite the fact that no AI program of the required sophistication yet exists.
   However, in 1989 there was a famous series of forged postings that used a phrase-frequency-based travesty generator to simulate the styles of several well-known flamers; it was based on large samples of their back postings (compare :ref:`Dissociated-Press`\).
   A significant number of people were fooled by the forgeries, and the debate over their authenticity was settled only when the perpetrator came forward to publicly admit the hoax.
