vt\.

[from automotive or musical usage] To optimize a program or system for a particular environment, esp.
by adjusting numerical parameters designed as :ref:`hook`\s for tuning, e.g., by changing :code:`#define` lines in C. One may tune for time (fastest execution), tune for space (least memory use), or tune for configuration (most efficient use of hardware).
See :ref:`hot-spot`\, :ref:`hand-hacking`\.
