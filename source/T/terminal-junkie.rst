terminal junkie
============================================================

n\.

[UK] A :ref:`wannabee` or early :ref:`larval-stage` hacker who spends most of his or her time wandering the directory tree and writing :ref:`noddy` programs just to get a fix of computer time.
Variants include terminal jockey, console junkie, and :ref:`console-jockey`\.
The term console jockey seems to imply more expertise than the other three (possibly because of the exalted status of the :ref:`console` relative to an ordinary terminal).
See also :ref:`twink`\, :ref:`read-only-user`\.
Appropriately, this term was used in the works of William S. Burroughs to describe a heroin addict with an unlimited supply.
