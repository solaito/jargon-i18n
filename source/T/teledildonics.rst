/tel\`\@·dil·do'·niks/, n\.

Sex in a computer simulated virtual reality, esp.
computer-mediated sexual interaction between the :ref:`VR` presences of two humans.
This practice is not yet possible except in the rather limited form of erotic conversation on :ref:`MUD`\s and the like.
The term, however, is widely recognized in the VR community as a :ref:`ha-ha-only-serious` projection of things to come.
"When we can sustain a multi-sensory surround good enough for teledildonics, then we'll know we're getting somewhere."
