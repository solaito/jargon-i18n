n\.

The software equivalent of a tool-and-die specialist; one who specializes in making the :ref:`tool`\s with which other programmers create applications.
Many hackers consider this more fun than applications per se; to understand why, see :ref:`uninteresting`\.
Jon Bentley, in the "Bumper-Sticker Computer Science" chapter of his book *More Programming Pearls*\, quotes Dick Sites from :ref:`DEC` as saying "I'd rather write programs to write programs than write programs".
