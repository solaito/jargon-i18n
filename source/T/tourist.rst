n\.

1.
   [ITS] A guest on the system, especially one who generally logs in over a network from a remote location for :ref:`comm-mode`\, email, games, and other trivial purposes.
   One step below :ref:`luser`\.
   ITS hackers often used to spell this :ref:`turist`\, perhaps by some sort of tenuous analogy with :ref:`luser` (this usage may also have expressed the ITS culture's penchant for six-letterisms, and/or been some sort of tribute to Alan Turing).
   Compare :ref:`twink`\, :ref:`lurker`\, :ref:`read-only-user`\.

2.
   [IRC] An :ref:`IRC` user who goes from channel to channel without saying anything; see :ref:`channel-hopping`\.
