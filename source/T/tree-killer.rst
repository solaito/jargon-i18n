n\.

[Sun]

1.
   A printer.

2.
   A person who wastes paper.
   This epithet should be interpreted in a broad sense; ‘wasting paper’ includes the production of :ref:`spiffy` but :ref:`content-free` documents.
   Thus, most :ref:`suit`\s are tree-killers.

It is likely that both senses derive their flavor from the epithet ‘tree-killer’ applied by Treebeard the Ent to the Orcs in J.R.R.
Tolkien's *Lord of the Rings*\.
See also :ref:`elvish`\, :ref:`elder-days`\, and especially :ref:`dead-tree-version`\.
