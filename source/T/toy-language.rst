toy language

n\.

A language useful for instructional purposes or as a proof-of-concept for some aspect of computer-science theory, but inadequate for general-purpose programming.
:ref:`Bad-Thing`\s can result when a toy language is promoted as a general purpose solution for programming (see :ref:`bondage-and-discipline-language`\); the classic example is :ref:`Pascal`\.
Several moderately well-known formalisms for conceptual tasks such as programming Turing machines also qualify as toy languages in a less negative sense.
