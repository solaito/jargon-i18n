the literature

n\.

Computer-science journals and other publications, vaguely gestured at to answer a question that the speaker believes is :ref:`trivial`\.
Thus, one might answer an annoying question by saying "It's in the literature."
Oppose :ref:`Knuth`\, which has no connotation of triviality.
