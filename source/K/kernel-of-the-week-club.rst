kernel-of-the-week club
============================================================

The fictional society that :ref:`BSD` :ref:`bigot`\s claim :ref:`Linux` users belong to, alluding to the release-early-release-often style preferred by the kernel maintainers.
See :ref:`bazaar`\.
This was almost certainly inspired by the earlier :ref:`bug-of-the-month-club`\.
