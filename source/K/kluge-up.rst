To lash together a quick hack to perform a task; this is milder than :ref:`cruft-together` and has some of the connotations of :ref:`hack-up` (note, however, that the construction kluge on corresponding to :ref:`hack-on` is never used).
"I've kluged up this routine to dump the buffer contents to a safe place."
