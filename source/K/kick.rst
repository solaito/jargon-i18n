v\.

1.
   [IRC] To cause somebody to be removed from a :ref:`IRC` channel, an option only available to channel ops.
   This is an extreme measure, often used to combat extreme :ref:`flamage` or :ref:`flood`\ing, but sometimes used at the :ref:`CHOP`\'s whim.

2.
   To reboot a machine or kill a running process.
   "The server's down, let me go kick it."
