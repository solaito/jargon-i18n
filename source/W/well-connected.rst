adj\.

Said of a computer installation, asserts that it has reliable email links with the network and/or that it relays a large fraction of available :ref:`Usenet` newsgroups.
Well-known can be almost synonymous, but also implies that the site's name is familiar to many (due perhaps to an archive service or active Usenet users).
