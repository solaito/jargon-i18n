weenie
============================================================

n\.

1.
   [on BBSes] Any of a species of luser resembling a less amusing version of :ref:`B1FF` that infests many :ref:`BBS` systems.
   The typical weenie is a teenage boy with poor social skills travelling under a grandiose :ref:`handle` derived from fantasy or heavy-metal rock lyrics.
   Among sysops, the weenie problem refers to the marginally literate and profanity-laden :ref:`flamage` weenies tend to spew all over a newly-discovered BBS.
   Compare :ref:`spod`\, :ref:`geek`\, :ref:`terminal-junkie`\, :ref:`warez-d00dz`\.

2.
   [among hackers] When used with a qualifier (for example, as in :ref:`Unix-weenie`\, VMS weenie, IBM weenie) this can be either an insult or a term of praise, depending on context, tone of voice, and whether or not it is applied by a person who considers him or herself to be the same sort of weenie.
   Implies that the weenie has put a major investment of time, effort, and concentration into the area indicated; whether this is good or bad depends on the hearer's judgment of how the speaker feels about that area.
   See also :ref:`bigot`\.

3.
   The semicolon character, ``;`` (ASCII 0111011).
