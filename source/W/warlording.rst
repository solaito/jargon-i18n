v\.

[from the Usenet group :samp:`alt.fan.warlord`\] The act of excoriating a bloated, ugly, or derivative :ref:`sig-block`\.
Common grounds for warlording include the presence of a signature rendered in a :ref:`BUAF`\, over-used or cliched :ref:`sig-quote`\s, ugly :ref:`ASCII-art`\, or simply excessive size.
The original ‘Warlord’ was a :ref:`B1FF`\-like :ref:`newbie` c.1991 who featured in his sig a particularly large and obnoxious ASCII graphic resembling the sword of Conan the Barbarian in the 1981 John Milius movie; the group name :samp:`alt.fan.warlord` was sarcasm, and the characteristic mode of warlording is devastatingly sarcastic praise.
