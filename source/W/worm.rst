n\.

[from tapeworm in John Brunner's novel *The Shockwave Rider*\, via XEROX PARC] A program that propagates itself over a network, reproducing itself as it goes.
Compare :ref:`virus`\.
Nowadays the term has negative connotations, as it is assumed that only :ref:`cracker`\s write worms.
Perhaps the best-known example was Robert T. Morris's :ref:`Great-Worm` of 1988, a ‘benign’ one that got out of control and hogged hundreds of Suns and VAXen across the U.S. See also :ref:`cracker`\, :ref:`RTM`\, :ref:`Trojan-horse`\, :ref:`ice`\.
