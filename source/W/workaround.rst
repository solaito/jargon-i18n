workaround
============================================================

n\.

1.
   A temporary :ref:`kluge` used to bypass, mask, or otherwise avoid a :ref:`bug` or :ref:`misfeature` in some system.
   Theoretically, workarounds are always replaced by :ref:`fix`\es; in practice, customers often find themselves living with workarounds for long periods of time.
   "The code died on NUL characters in the input, so I fixed it to interpret them as spaces."
   "That's not a fix, that's a workaround!"

2.
   A procedure to be employed by the user in order to do what some currently non-working feature should do.
   Hypothetical example: "Using META-F7 :ref:`crash`\es the 4.43 build of Weemax, but as a workaround you can type CTRL-R, then SHIFT-F5, and delete the remaining :ref:`cruft` by hand."
