According to arch-hacker James Gosling (designer of :ref:`NeWS`\, :ref:`GOSMACS` and Java), to "...modify a program with no idea whatsoever how it works."
(See :ref:`whacker`\.)
It is actually possible to do this in nontrivial circumstances if the change is small and well-defined and you are very good at :ref:`glark`\ing things from context.
As a trivial example, it is relatively easy to change all :code:`stderr` writes to :code:`stdout` writes in a piece of C filter code which remains otherwise mysterious.
