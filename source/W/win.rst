.. _win:

============================================================
win
============================================================

[MIT; now common everywhere]

1. vi\.
   To succeed.
   A program wins if no unexpected conditions arise, or (especially) if it is sufficiently :ref:`robust` to take exceptions in stride.

2. n\.
   Success, or a specific instance thereof.
   A pleasing outcome.
   "So it turned out I could use a :ref:`lexer` generator instead of hand-coding my own pattern recognizer.
   What a win!"
   Emphatic forms: moby win, super win, hyper-win (often used interjectively as a reply).
   For some reason suitable win is also common at MIT, usually in reference to a satisfactory solution to a problem.
   Oppose :ref:`lose`\; see also :ref:`big-win`\, which isn't quite just an intensification of win.
