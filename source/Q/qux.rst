/kwuhks/

The fourth of the standard :ref:`metasyntactic-variable`\, after :ref:`baz` and before the quu(u...)x series.
See :ref:`foo`\, :ref:`bar`\, :ref:`baz`\, :ref:`quux`\.
This appears to be a recent mutation from :ref:`quux`\, and many versions (especially older versions) of the standard series just run :ref:`foo`\, :ref:`bar`\, :ref:`baz`\, :ref:`quux`\, ....
