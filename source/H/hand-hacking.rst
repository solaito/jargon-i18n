n\.

1.
   [rare] The practice of translating :ref:`hot-spot`\s from an :ref:`HLL` into hand-tuned assembler, as opposed to trying to coerce the compiler into generating better code.
   Both the term and the practice are becoming uncommon.
   See :ref:`tune`\, :ref:`by-hand`\; syn.
   with v. :ref:`cruft`\.

2.
   [common] More generally, manual construction or patching of data sets that would normally be generated by a translation utility and interpreted by another program, and aren't really designed to be read or modified by humans.
