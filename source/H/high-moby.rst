high moby

/hi:´ mohb´ee/, n\.

The high half of a 512K :ref:`PDP-10`\'s physical address space; the other half was of course the low moby.
This usage has been generalized in a way that has outlasted the :ref:`PDP-10`\; for example, at the 1990 Washington D.C. Area Science Fiction Conclave (Disclave), when a miscommunication resulted in two separate wakes being held in commemoration of the shutdown of MIT's last :ref:`ITS` machines, the one on the upper floor was dubbed the ‘high moby’ and the other the ‘low moby’.
All parties involved :ref:`grok`\ked this instantly.
See :ref:`moby`\.
