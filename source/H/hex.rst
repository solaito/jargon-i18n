.. _hex:

============================================================
hex
============================================================

n\.

1.
   Short for :ref:`hexadecimal`\, base 16.

2.
   A 6-pack of anything (compare :ref:`quad`\, sense 2).
   Neither usage has anything to do with :ref:`magic` or :ref:`black-art`\, though the pun is appreciated and occasionally used by hackers.
   True story: As a joke, some hackers once offered some surplus ICs for sale to be worn as protective amulets against hostile magic.
   The chips were, of course, hex inverters.
