hung
============================================================

adj\.

[from ‘hung up’; common] Equivalent to :ref:`wedged`\, but more common at Unix/C sites.
Not generally used of people.
Syn.
with :ref:`locked-up`\, :ref:`wedged`\; compare :ref:`hosed`\.
See also :ref:`hang`\.
A hung state is distinguished from :ref:`crash`\ed or :ref:`down`\, where the program or system is also unusable but because it is not running rather than because it is waiting for something.
However, the recovery from both situations is often the same.
It is also distinguished from the similar but more drastic state :ref:`wedged` — hung software can be woken up with easy things like interrupt keys, but wedged will need a kill -9 or even reboot.
