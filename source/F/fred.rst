n\.

1.
   The personal name most frequently used as a :ref:`metasyntactic-variable` (see :ref:`foo`\).
   Allegedly popular because it's easy for a non-touch-typist to type on a standard QWERTY keyboard.
   In Great Britain, ‘fred’, ‘jim’ and ‘sheila’ are common metasyntactic variables because their uppercase versions were *official* names given to the 3 memory areas that held I/O status registers on the lovingly-remembered BBC Microcomputer!
   (It is reported that SHEILA was poked the most often.)
   Unlike :ref:`J--Random-Hacker` or J.
   Random Loser, the name ‘fred’ has no positive or negative loading (but see :ref:`Dr--Fred-Mbogo`\).
   See also :ref:`barney`\.

2.
   An acronym for ‘Flipping Ridiculous Electronic Device’; other F-verbs may be substituted for ‘flipping’.
