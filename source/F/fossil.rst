n\.

1.
   In software, a misfeature that becomes understandable only in historical context, as a remnant of times past retained so as not to break compatibility.
   Example: the retention of octal as default base for string escapes in :ref:`C`\, in spite of the better match of hexadecimal to ASCII and modern byte-addressable architectures.
   See :ref:`dusty-deck`\.

2.
   More restrictively, a feature with past but no present utility.
   Example: the force-all-caps (LCASE) bits in the V7 and :ref:`BSD` Unix tty driver, designed for use with monocase terminals.
   (In a perversion of the usual backward-compatibility goal, this functionality has actually been expanded and renamed in some later USG Unix releases as the IUCLC and OLCUC bits.)
