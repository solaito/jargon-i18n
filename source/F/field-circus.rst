n\.

[a derogatory pun on ‘field service’] The field service organization of any hardware manufacturer, but originally :ref:`DEC`\.
There is an entire genre of jokes about field circus engineers:

.. code-block:: none


   Q: How can you recognize a field circus engineer
      with a flat tire?
   A: He's changing one tire at a time to see which one is flat.

   Q: How can you recognize a field circus engineer
      who is out of gas?
   A: He's changing one tire at a time to see which one is flat.

   Q: How can you tell it's your field circus engineer?
   A: The spare is flat, too.

[See :ref:`Easter-egging` for additional insight on these jokes.]

There is also the ‘Field Circus Cheer’ (from the old :ref:`plan-file` for DEC on MIT-AI):

.. code-block:: none


   Maynard! Maynard!
   Don't mess with us!
   We're mean and we're tough!
   If you get us confused
   We'll screw up your stuff.

(DEC's service HQ, still extant under the HP regime, is located in Maynard, Massachusetts.)
