/fus'·king/, /eff'·seek·ing/, adj\.

[Usenet; very common] Fucking, in the expletive sense (it refers to the Unix filesystem-repair command :manpage:`fsck(8)`\, of which it can be said that if you have to use it at all you are having a bad day).
Originated on :ref:`scary-devil-monastery` and the :samp:`bofh.net` newsgroups, but became much more widespread following the passage of :ref:`CDA`\.
Also occasionally seen in the variant "What the fsck?"
