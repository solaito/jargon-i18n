[Usenet; written, only rarely spoken] Written-only equivalent of "Sheesh!
"; it is, in fact, "sheesh" modified by :ref:`rot13`\.
Evolved in mid-1992 as a response to notably silly postings repeating urban myths on the Usenet newsgroup :samp:`alt.folklore.urban`\, after some posters complained that "Sheesh!"
as a response to :ref:`newbie`\s was being overused.
See also :ref:`FOAF`\.
