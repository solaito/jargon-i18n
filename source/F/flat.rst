.. _flat:

============================================================
flat
============================================================

adj\.

1.
   [common] Lacking any complex internal structure.
   "That :ref:`bitty-box` has only a flat filesystem, not a hierarchical one."
   The verb form is :ref:`flatten`\.

2.
   Said of a memory architecture (like that of the :ref:`VAX` or 680x0) that is one big linear address space (typically with each possible value of a processor register corresponding to a unique core address), as opposed to a segmented architecture (like that of the 80x86) in which addresses are composed from a base-register/offset pair (segmented designs are generally considered :ref:`cretinous`\).

Note that sense 1 (at least with respect to filesystems) is usually used pejoratively, while sense 2 is a :ref:`Good-Thing`\.
