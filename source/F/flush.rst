.. _flush:

============================================================
flush
============================================================

v\.

1.
   [common] To delete something, usually superfluous, or to abort an operation.
   "All that nonsense has been flushed."

2.
   [Unix/C] To force buffered I/O to disk, as with an :manpage:`fflush(3)` call.
   This is *not* an abort or deletion as in sense 1, but a demand for early completion!

3.
   To leave at the end of a day's work (as opposed to leaving for a meal).
   "I'm going to flush now."
   "Time to flush."

4.
   To exclude someone from an activity, or to ignore a person.

‘Flush’ was standard ITS terminology for aborting an output operation; one spoke of the text that would have been printed, but was not, as having been flushed.
It is speculated that this term arose from a vivid image of flushing unwanted characters by hosing down the internal output buffer, washing the characters away before they could be printed.
The Unix/C usage, on the other hand, was propagated by the :manpage:`fflush(3)` call in C's standard I/O library (though it is reported to have been in use among BLISS programmers at :ref:`DEC` and on Honeywell and IBM machines as far back as 1965).
Unix/C hackers found the ITS usage confusing, and vice versa.
