n\.

An excess of capability that serves no productive end.
The canonical example is font-diddling software on the Mac (see :ref:`macdink`\); the term describes anything that eats huge amounts of time for quite marginal gains in function but seduces people into using it anyway.
See also :ref:`window-shopping`\.
