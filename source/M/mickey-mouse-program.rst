mickey mouse program
============================================================

n\.

North American equivalent of a :ref:`noddy` (that is, trivial) program.
Doesn't necessarily have the belittling connotations of mainstream slang "Oh, that's just mickey mouse stuff!
"; sometimes trivial programs can be very useful.
