/man´del·buhg/, n\.

[from the Mandelbrot set] A bug whose underlying causes are so complex and obscure as to make its behavior appear chaotic or even non-deterministic.
This term implies that the speaker thinks it is a :ref:`Bohr-bug`\, rather than a :ref:`heisenbug`\.
See also :ref:`schroedinbug`\.
