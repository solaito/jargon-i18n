n\.

1.
   Spam emitted by a reputable, mainstream company (as opposed to fly-by-night Viagra oeddlers and the like).
   Sometime this happens in honest ignorance, but the reputation danage can take years to live down.

2.
   Occasionally used for a big-time spammer, with its own :ref:`fat-pipe`\, their own mailservers, and a :ref:`pink-contract`\.
   Almost impossible to get shut down.
