.. _meta-bit:

============================================================
meta bit
============================================================

n\.

The top bit of an 8-bit character, which is on in character values 128--255.
Also called :ref:`high-bit`\, :ref:`alt-bit`\.
Some terminals and consoles (see :ref:`space-cadet-keyboard`\) have a META shift key.
Others (including, *mirabile dictu*\, keyboards on IBM PC-class machines) have an ALT key.
See also :ref:`bucky-bits`\.

Historical note: although in modern usage shaped by a universe of 8-bit bytes the meta bit is invariably hex 80 (octal 0200), things were different on earlier machines with 36-bit words and 9-bit bytes.
The MIT and Stanford keyboards (see :ref:`space-cadet-keyboard`\) generated hex 100 (octal 400) from their meta keys.
