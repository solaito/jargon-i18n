mode bit

n\.

[common] A :ref:`flag`\, usually in hardware, that selects between two (usually quite different) modes of operation.
The connotations are different from :ref:`flag` bit in that mode bits are mainly written during a boot or set-up phase, are seldom explicitly read, and seldom change over the lifetime of an ordinary program.
The classic example was the EBCDIC-vs.-ASCII bit (#12) of the Program Status Word of the IBM 360.
