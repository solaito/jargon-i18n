/mak·rol'\@·jee/, n\.

1.
   Set of usually complex or crufty macros, e.g., as part of a large system written in :ref:`LISP`\, :ref:`TECO`\, or (less commonly) assembler.

2.
   The art and science involved in comprehending a macrology in sense 1.
   Sometimes studying the macrology of a system is not unlike archeology, ecology, or :ref:`theology`\, hence the sound-alike construction.
   See also :ref:`boxology`\.
