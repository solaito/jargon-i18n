[very common]

1.
   Short for ‘modify’ or ‘modification’.
   Very commonly used — in fact the full terms are considered markers that one is being formal.
   The plural ‘mods’ is used esp.
   with reference to bug fixes or minor design changes in hardware or software, most esp.
   with respect to :ref:`patch` sets or a :ref:`diff`\.
   See also :ref:`case-mod`\.

2.
   Short for :ref:`modulo` but used *only* for its techspeak sense.
