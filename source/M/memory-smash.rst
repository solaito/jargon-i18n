n\.

[XEROX PARC] Writing through a pointer that doesn't point to what you think it does.
This occasionally reduces your memory to a rubble of bits.
Note that this is subtly different from (and more general than) related terms such as a :ref:`memory-leak` or :ref:`fandango-on-core` because it doesn't imply an allocation error or overrun condition.
