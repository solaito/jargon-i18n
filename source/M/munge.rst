/muhnj/, vt\.

1.
   [derogatory] To imperfectly transform information.

2.
   A comprehensive rewrite of a routine, data structure or the whole program.

3.
   To modify data in some way the speaker doesn't need to go into right now or cannot describe succinctly (compare :ref:`mumble`\).

4.
   To add :ref:`spamblock` to an email address.

This term is often confused with :ref:`mung`\, which probably was derived from it.
However, it also appears the word munge was in common use in Scotland in the 1940s, and in Yorkshire in the 1950s, as a verb, meaning to munch up into a masticated mess, and as a noun, meaning the result of munging something up (the parallel with the :ref:`kluge`\/ :ref:`kludge` pair is amusing).
The OED reports "munge" as an archaic verb meaning "to wipe (a person's nose)".
