1.
   What the Opus BBS software and sysops call :ref:`FidoNet`\.

2.
   Fanciful term for a :ref:`cyberspace` expected to emerge from current networking experiments (see :ref:`the-network`\).
   The name of the rather good 1999 :ref:`cypherpunk` movie *The Matrix* played on this sense, which however had been established for years before.

3.
   The totality of present-day computer networks (popularized in this sense by John Quarterman; rare outside academic literature).
