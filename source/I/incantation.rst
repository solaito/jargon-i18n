incantation
============================================================

n\.

Any particularly arbitrary or obscure command that one must mutter at a system to attain a desired result.
Not used of passwords or other explicit security features.
Especially used of tricks that are so poorly documented that they must be learned from a :ref:`wizard`\.
"This compiler normally locates initialized data in the data segment, but if you :ref:`mutter` the right incantation they will be forced into text space."
