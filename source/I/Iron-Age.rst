Iron Age

n\.

In the history of computing, 1961-1971 â€” the formative era of commercial :ref:`mainframe` technology, when ferrite-core :ref:`dinosaur`\s ruled the earth.
The Iron Age began, ironically enough, with the delivery of the first minicomputer (the PDP-1) and ended with the introduction of the first commercial microprocessor (the Intel 4004) in 1971.
