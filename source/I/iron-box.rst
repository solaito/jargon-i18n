n\.

[Unix/Internet] A special environment set up to trap a :ref:`cracker` logging in over remote connections long enough to be traced.
May include a modified :ref:`shell` restricting the cracker's movements in unobvious ways, and ‘bait’ files designed to keep him interested and logged on.
See also :ref:`back-door`\, :ref:`firewall-machine`\, :ref:`Venus-flytrap`\, and Clifford Stoll's account in * The Cuckoo's Egg* of how he made and used one (see the :ref:`Bibliography<bibliography>` in Appendix C).
Compare :ref:`padded-cell`\, :ref:`honey-pot`\.
