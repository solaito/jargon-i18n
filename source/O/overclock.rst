/oh´vr·klok´/, vt\.

To operate a CPU or other digital logic device at a rate higher than it was designed for, under the assumption that the manufacturer put some :ref:`slop` into the specification to account for manufacturing tolerances.
Overclocking something can result in intermittent :ref:`crash`\es, and can even burn things out, since power dissipation is directly proportional to :ref:`clock` frequency.
People who make a hobby of this are sometimes called "overclockers"; they are thrilled that they can run their CPU a few percent faster, even though they can only tell the difference by running a :ref:`benchmark` program.
See also :ref:`case-mod`\.
