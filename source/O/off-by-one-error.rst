off-by-one error
============================================================

n\.

[common] Exceedingly common error induced in many ways, such as by starting at 0 when you should have started at 1 or vice-versa, or by writing :code:`< N` instead of :code:`<= N` or vice-versa.
Also applied to giving something to the person next to the one who should have gotten it.
Often confounded with :ref:`fencepost-error`\, which is properly a particular subtype of it.
