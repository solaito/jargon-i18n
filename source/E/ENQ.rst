/enkw/, /enk/

[from the ASCII mnemonic ENQuire for 0000101] An on-line convention for querying someone's availability.
After opening a :ref:`talk-mode` connection to someone apparently in heavy hack mode, one might type :code:`SYN SYN ENQ?` (the SYNs representing notional synchronization bytes), and expect a return of :ref:`ACK` or :ref:`NAK` depending on whether or not the person felt interruptible.
Compare :ref:`ping`\, :ref:`finger`\, and the usage of :code:`FOO?` listed under :ref:`talk-mode`\.
