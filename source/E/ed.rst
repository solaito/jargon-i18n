n\.

"ed is the standard text editor."
Line taken from the original :ref:`Unix` manual page on ed, an ancient line-oriented editor that is by now used only by a few :ref:`Real-Programmer`\s, and even then only for batch operations.
The original line is sometimes uttered near the beginning of an emacs vs. vi holy war on :ref:`Usenet`\, with the (vain) hope to quench the discussion before it really takes off.
Often followed by a standard text describing the many virtues of ed (such as the small memory :ref:`footprint` on a Timex Sinclair, and the consistent (because nearly non-existent) user interface).
