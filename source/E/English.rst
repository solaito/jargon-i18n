1. n\.
   obs.
   The source code for a program, which may be in any language, as opposed to the linkable or executable binary produced from it by a compiler.
   The idea behind the term is that to a real hacker, a program written in his favorite programming language is at least as readable as English.
   Usage: mostly by old-time hackers, though recognizable in context.
   Today the preferred shorthand is simply :ref:`source`\.

2.
   The official name of the database language used by the old Pick Operating System, actually a sort of crufty, brain-damaged SQL with delusions of grandeur.
   The name permitted :ref:`marketroid`\s to say "Yes, and you can program our computers in English!"
   to ignorant :ref:`suit`\s without quite running afoul of the truth-in-advertising laws.
