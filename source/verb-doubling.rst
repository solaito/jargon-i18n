Verb Doubling
============================================================

A standard construction in English is to double a verb and use it as an exclamation, such as "Bang, bang!"
or "Quack, quack!".
Most of these are names for noises.
Hackers also double verbs as a concise, sometimes sarcastic comment on what the implied subject does.
Also, a doubled verb is often used to terminate a conversation, in the process remarking on the current state of affairs or what the speaker intends to do next.
Typical examples involve :ref:`win`\, :ref:`lose`\, :ref:`hack`\, :ref:`flame`\, :ref:`barf`\, :ref:`chomp`\:

   The disk heads just crashed. Lose,
   lose.
   Mostly he talked about his latest crock.  Flame,
   flame.
   “Boy, what a bagbiter!  Chomp, chomp!

Some verb-doubled constructions have special meanings not immediately obvious from the verb.
These have their own listings in the lexicon.

The :ref:`Usenet` culture has one *tripling* convention unrelated to this; the names of ‘joke’ topic groups often have a tripled last element.
The first and paradigmatic example was :samp:`alt.swedish.chef.bork.bork.bork` (a *Muppet Show* reference); other infamous examples have included:

- :samp:`alt.french.captain.borg.borg.borg`

- :samp:`alt.wesley.crusher.die.die.die`

- :samp:`comp.unix.internals.system.calls.brk.brk.brk`

- :samp:`sci.physics.edward.teller.boom.boom.boom`

- :samp:`alt.sadistic.dentists.drill.drill.drill`

These two traditions fuse in the newsgroup :samp:`alt.adjective.noun.verb.verb.verb`\, devoted to humor based on deliberately confounding parts of speech.
Several observers have noted that the contents of this group is excellently representative of the peculiarities of hacker humor.
