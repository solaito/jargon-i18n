n\.

[from the children's TV program *Sesame Street*\] Any of a family of early (1970s) hacks reported on :ref:`TOPS-10`\, :ref:`ITS`\, :ref:`Multics`\, and elsewhere that would lock up either the victim's terminal (on a timesharing machine) or the :ref:`console` (on a batch :ref:`mainframe`\), repeatedly demanding "I WANT A COOKIE".
The required responses ranged in complexity from "COOKIE" through "HAVE A COOKIE" and upward.
Folklorist Jan Brunvand (see :ref:`FOAF`\) has described these programs as urban legends (implying they probably never existed) but they existed, all right, in several different versions.
See also :ref:`wabbit`\.
Interestingly, the term cookie monster appears to be a :ref:`retcon`\; the original term was :ref:`cookie-bear`\.
