n\.

[from amateur electronics and radio] A book of small code segments that the reader can use to do various :ref:`magic` things in programs.
Cookbooks, slavishly followed, can lead one into :ref:`voodoo-programming`\, but are useful for hackers trying to :ref:`monkey-up` small programs in unknown languages.
This function is analogous to the role of phrasebooks in human languages.
