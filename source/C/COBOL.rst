[COmmon Business-Oriented Language] (Synonymous with :ref:`evil`\.)
A weak, verbose, and flabby language used by :ref:`code-grinder`\s to do boring mindless things on :ref:`dinosaur` mainframes.
Hackers believe that all COBOL programmers are :ref:`suit`\s or :ref:`code-grinder`\s, and no self-respecting hacker will ever admit to having learned the language.
Its very name is seldom uttered without ritual expressions of disgust or horror.
One popular one is Edsger W. Dijkstra's famous observation that "The use of COBOL cripples the mind; its teaching should, therefore, be regarded as a criminal offense."
