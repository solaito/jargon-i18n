/C'·pluhs·pluhs/, n\.

Designed by Bjarne Stroustrup of AT&T Bell Labs as a successor to :ref:`C`\.
Now one of the :ref:`languages-of-choice`\, although many hackers still grumble that it is the successor to either Algol 68 or Ada (depending on generation), and a prime example of :ref:`second-system-effect`\.
Almost anything that can be done in any language can be done in C++, but it requires a :ref:`language-lawyer` to know what is and what is not legal — the design is *almost* too large to hold in even hackers' heads.
Much of the :ref:`cruft` results from C++'s attempt to be backward compatible with C. Stroustrup himself has said in his retrospective book *The Design and Evolution of C++* (p. 207), "Within C++, there is a much smaller and cleaner language struggling to get out."
[Many hackers would now add "Yes, and it's called :ref:`Java`\" —ESR]
