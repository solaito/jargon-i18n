.. _cd-tilde:

============================================================
cd tilde
============================================================

/C·D til·d\@/, vi\.

To go home.
From the Unix C-shell and Korn-shell command :code:`cd ~`\, which takes one to one's :code:`$HOME` (:code:`cd` with no arguments happens to do the same thing).
By extension, may be used with other arguments; thus, over an electronic chat link, :code:`cd ~coffee` would mean "I'm going to the coffee machine."
