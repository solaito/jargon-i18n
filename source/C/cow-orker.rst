n\.

[Usenet] n. fortuitous typo for co-worker, widely used in Usenet, with perhaps a hint that orking cows is illegal.
This term was popularized by Scott Adams (the creator of :ref:`Dilbert`\) but already appears in the January 1996 version of the :ref:`scary-devil-monastery` FAQ, and has been traced back to a 1989 :ref:`sig-block`\.
