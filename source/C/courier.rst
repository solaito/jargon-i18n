[BBS & cracker cultures] A person who distributes newly cracked :ref:`warez`\, as opposed to a :ref:`server` who makes them available for download or a :ref:`leech` who merely downloads them.
Hackers recognize this term but don't use it themselves, as the act is not part of their culture.
See also :ref:`warez-d00dz`\, :ref:`cracker`\, :ref:`elite`\.
