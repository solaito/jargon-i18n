.. _condition-out:

============================================================
condition out
============================================================

vt\.

To prevent a section of code from being compiled by surrounding it with a conditional-compilation directive whose condition is always false.
The :ref:`canonical` examples of these directives are :code:`#if 0` (or :code:`#ifdef notdef`\, though some find the latter :ref:`bletcherous`\) and :code:`#endif` in C. Compare :ref:`comment-out`\.
