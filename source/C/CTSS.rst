Compatible Time-Sharing System.
An early (1963) experiment in the design of interactive timesharing operating systems, ancestral to :ref:`Multics`\, :ref:`Unix`\, and :ref:`ITS`\.
The name :ref:`ITS` (Incompatible Time-sharing System) was a hack on CTSS, meant both as a joke and to express some basic differences in philosophy about the way I/O services should be presented to user programs.
