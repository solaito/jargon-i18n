//, n\.

Synonymous with :ref:`IYFEG`\.
At one time, people in the Usenet newsgroup :samp:`rec.humor.funny` tended to use ‘JEDR’ instead of :ref:`IYFEG` or ‘<ethnic>’; this stemmed from a public attempt to suppress the group once made by a loser with initials JEDR after he was offended by an ethnic joke posted there.
(The practice was :ref:`retcon`\ned by expanding these initials as ‘Joke Ethnic/Denomination/Race’.)
After much sound and fury JEDR faded away; this term appears to be doing likewise.
JEDR's only permanent effect on the net.culture was to discredit ‘sensitivity’ arguments for censorship so thoroughly that more recent attempts to raise them have met with immediate and near-universal rejection.
