n\.

[Usenet: by analogy with :ref:`spam`\] A message that is both excessively cross-posted and too frequently posted, as opposed to :ref:`spam` (which is merely too frequently posted) or :ref:`velveeta` (which is merely excessively cross-posted).
This term is widely recognized but not commonly used; most people refer to both kinds of abuse or their combination as spam.
