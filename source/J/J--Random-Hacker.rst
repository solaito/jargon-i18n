J. Random Hacker
============================================================

/J rand´m hak´r/, n\.

[very common] A mythical figure like the Unknown Soldier; the archetypal hacker nerd.
This term is one of the oldest in the jargon, apparently going back to MIT in the 1960s.
See :ref:`random`\, :ref:`Suzie-COBOL`\.
This may originally have been inspired by ‘J.
Fred Muggs’, a show-biz chimpanzee whose name was a household word back in the early days of :ref:`TMRC`\, and was probably influenced by ‘J.
Presper Eckert’ (one of the co-inventors of the electronic computer).
