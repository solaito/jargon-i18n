v\.

To log on to a machine or connect to a network or :ref:`BBS`\, esp.
for purposes of entering a :ref:`virtual-reality` simulation such as a :ref:`MUD` or :ref:`IRC` (leaving is "jacking out").
This term derives from :ref:`cyberpunk` SF, in which it was used for the act of plugging an electrode set into neural sockets in order to interface the brain directly to a virtual reality.
It is primarily used by MUD and IRC fans and younger hackers on BBS systems.
