Jeff K.
============================================================

The spiritual successor to :ref:`B1FF` and the archetype of :ref:`script-kiddies`\.
Jeff K. is a sixteen-year-old suburbanite who fancies himself a "l33t haX0r", although his knowledge of computers seems to be limited to the procedure for getting Quake up and running.
His Web page `http://www.somethingawful.com/jeffk/ <http://www.somethingawful.com/jeffk/>`_\  features a number of hopelessly naive articles, essays, and rants, all filled with the kind of misspellings, :ref:`studlycaps`\, and number-for-letter substitutions endemic to the script kiddie and :ref:`warez-d00dz` communities.
Jeff's offerings, among other things, include hardware advice (such as "AMD VERSIS PENTIUM" and "HOW TO OVARCLOAK YOUR COMPUTAR"), his own Quake clan (Clan 40 OUNSCE), and his own comic strip (Wacky Fun Computar Comic Jokes).

Like B1FF, Jeff K. is (fortunately) a hoax.
Jeff K. was created by internet game journalist Richard "Lowtax" Kyanka, whose web site Something Awful (http://www.somethingawful.com) highlights unintentionally humorous news items and Web sites, as a parody of the kind of teenage :ref:`luser` who infests Quake servers, chat rooms, and other places where computer enthusiasts congregate.
He is well-recognized in the PC game community and his influence has spread to hacker :ref:`fora` like Slashdot as well.
