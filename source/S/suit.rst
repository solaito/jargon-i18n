n\.

1.
   Ugly and uncomfortable ‘business clothing’ often worn by non-hackers.
   Invariably worn with a ‘tie’, a strangulation device that partially cuts off the blood supply to the brain.
   It is thought that this explains much about the behavior of suit-wearers.
   Compare :ref:`droid`\.

2.
   A person who habitually wears suits, as distinct from a techie or hacker.
