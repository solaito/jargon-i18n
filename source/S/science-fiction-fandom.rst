n\.

Another voluntary subculture having a very heavy overlap with hackerdom; most hackers read SF and/or fantasy fiction avidly, and many go to ‘cons’ (SF conventions) or are involved in fandom-connected activities such as the Society for Creative Anachronism.
Some hacker jargon originated in SF fandom; see :ref:`defenestration`\, :ref:`great-wall`\, :ref:`cyberpunk`\, :ref:`h`\, :ref:`ha-ha-only-serious`\, :ref:`IMHO`\, :ref:`mundane`\, :ref:`neep-neep`\, :ref:`Real-Soon-Now`\.
Additionally, the jargon terms :ref:`cowboy`\, :ref:`cyberspace`\, :ref:`de-rezz`\, :ref:`go-flatline`\, :ref:`ice`\, :ref:`phage`\, :ref:`virus`\, :ref:`wetware`\, :ref:`wirehead`\, and :ref:`worm` originated in SF stories.
