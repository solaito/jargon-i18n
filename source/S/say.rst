vt\.

1.
   To type to a terminal.
   "To list a directory verbosely, you have to say :code:`ls -l`\."
   Tends to imply a :ref:`newline`\-terminated command (a ‘sentence’).

2.
   A computer may also be said to ‘say’ things to you, even if it doesn't have a speech synthesizer, by displaying them on a terminal in response to your commands.
   Hackers find it odd that this usage confuses :ref:`mundane`\s.
