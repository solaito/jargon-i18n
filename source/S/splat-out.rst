v\.

[Usenet; syn.
disemvowel] To partially obscure a potentially provocative word by substituting :ref:`splat` characters for some of its letters (usually, but not always, the vowels).
The purpose is not to make the word unrecognizable but to make it a mention rather than a use, so that no flamewar ensues.
Words often splatted out include N\*z\* (see :ref:`Godwins-Law`\), k\*bo\* (see :ref:`KIBO`\, sense 2), \*v\*l\*t\*\*n (anywhere fundamentalists might be lurking), \*b\*rt\*\*n, and g\*n c\*ntr\*l. Compare :ref:`UN-asterisk-X`\.
