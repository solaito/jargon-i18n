The opposite of :ref:`syntactic-sugar`\, a feature designed to make it harder to write bad code.
Specifically, syntactic salt is a hoop the programmer must jump through just to prove that he knows what's going on, rather than to express a program action.
Some programmers consider required type declarations to be syntactic salt.
A requirement to write :code:`end if`\, :code:`end while`\, :code:`end do`\, etc.
: to terminate the last block controlled by a control construct (as opposed to just :code:`end`\) would definitely be syntactic salt.
Syntactic salt is like the real thing in that it tends to raise hackers' blood pressures in an unhealthy way.
Compare :ref:`candygrammar`\.
