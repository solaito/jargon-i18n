signal-to-noise ratio

n\.

[from analog electronics] Used by hackers in a generalization of its technical meaning.
‘Signal’ refers to useful information conveyed by some communications medium, and ‘noise’ to anything else on that medium.
Hence a low ratio implies that it is not worth paying attention to the medium in question.
Figures for such metaphorical ratios are never given.
The term is most often applied to :ref:`Usenet` newsgroups during :ref:`flame-war`\s.
Compare :ref:`bandwidth`\.
