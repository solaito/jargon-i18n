n\.

[from police slang for a cheap handgun] A :ref:`quick-and-dirty` program or feature kluged together during off hours, under a deadline, and in response to pressure from a :ref:`salescritter`\.
Such hacks are dangerously unreliable, but all too often sneak into a production release after insufficient review.
