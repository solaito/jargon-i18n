n\.

Term used among :ref:`cracker`\s and :ref:`samurai` for cracking techniques that rely on weaknesses in :ref:`wetware` rather than software; the aim is to trick people into revealing passwords or other information that compromises a target system's security.
Classic scams include phoning up a mark who has the required information and posing as a field service tech or a fellow employee with an urgent access problem.
