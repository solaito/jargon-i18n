syntactic sugar
============================================================

n\.

[coined by Peter Landin] Features added to a language or other formalism to make it ‘sweeter’ for humans, but which do not affect the expressiveness of the formalism (compare :ref:`chrome`\).
Used esp.
when there is an obvious and trivial translation of the ‘sugar’ feature into other constructs already present in the notation.
C's :code:`a[i]` notation is syntactic sugar for :manpage:`\*(a + i)`\.
"Syntactic sugar causes cancer of the semicolon."
— Alan Perlis.

The variants syntactic saccharin and syntactic syrup are also recorded.
These denote something even more gratuitous, in that syntactic sugar serves a purpose (making something more acceptable to humans), but syntactic saccharin or syrup serve no purpose at all.
Compare :ref:`candygrammar`\, :ref:`syntactic-salt`\.
