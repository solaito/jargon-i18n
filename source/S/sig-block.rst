/sig blok/, n\.

[Internet and Usenet; often written ‘.sig’ there] Short for ‘signature’, used specifically to refer to the electronic signature block that most Unix mail- and news-posting software will :ref:`automagically` append to outgoing mail and news.
The composition of one's sig can be quite an art form, including an ASCII logo, one's choice of witty sayings (see :ref:`sig-quote`\, :ref:`fool-file`\), or even source code for small programs about which the author wishes to make a statement; but many consider large sigs a waste of :ref:`bandwidth`\, and it has been observed that the size of one's sig block is usually inversely proportional to one's longevity and level of prestige on the net.
