   The Crunchly saga begins here.
   
   (The next cartoon in the Crunchly saga is  :ref:`73-05-18<crunchly73-05-18>`\.)
   

The infamous Crunchly cartoons by The Great Quux are woven into the lexicon, each next to an appropriate entry.
To read them in the sequence in which they were written, :ref:`chase-pointers` from here using the ‘next cartoon’ information in the captions.
A few don't have next pointers; these are vignettes from the 1973 *Crunchland* tableau spread that inaugurated the strip.

Here is a `framed <frames.html>`_\  version of the glossary.
