============================================================
bletcherous
============================================================

/blech'\@Â·r\@s/, adj\.

Disgusting in design or function; esthetically unappealing.
This word is seldom used of people.
"This keyboard is bletcherous!"
(Perhaps the keys don't work very well, or are misplaced.)
See :ref:`losing`\, :ref:`cretinous`\, :ref:`bagbiting`\, :ref:`bogus`\, and :ref:`random`\.
The term :ref:`bletcherous` applies to the esthetics of the thing so described; similarly for :ref:`cretinous`\.
By contrast, something that is losing or bagbiting may be failing to meet objective criteria.
See also :ref:`bogus` and :ref:`random`\, which have richer and wider shades of meaning than any of the above.
