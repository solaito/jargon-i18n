n\.

In Commonwealth hackish, barney is to :ref:`fred` (sense #1) as :ref:`bar` is to :ref:`foo`\.
That is, people who commonly use fred as their first metasyntactic variable will often use barney second.
The reference is, of course, to Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble in the Flintstones cartoons.
