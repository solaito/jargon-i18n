bondage-and-discipline language
============================================================

n\.

A language (such as :ref:`Pascal`\, Ada, APL, or Prolog) that, though ostensibly general-purpose, is designed so as to enforce an author's theory of ‘right programming’ even though said theory is demonstrably inadequate for systems hacking or even vanilla general-purpose programming.
Often abbreviated ‘B&D’; thus, one may speak of things "having the B&D nature".
See :ref:`Pascal`\; oppose :ref:`languages-of-choice`\.
