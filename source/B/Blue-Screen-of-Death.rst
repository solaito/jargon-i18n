Blue Screen of Death

n\.

[common] This term is closely related to the older :ref:`Black-Screen-of-Death` but much more common (many non-hackers have picked it up).
Due to the extreme fragility and bugginess of Microsoft Windows, misbehaving applications can readily crash the OS (and the OS sometimes crashes itself spontaneously).
The Blue Screen of Death, sometimes decorated with hex error codes, is what you get when this happens.
(Commonly abbreviated :ref:`BSOD`\.)
The following entry from the `Salon Haiku Contest <http://archive.salon.com/21st/chal/1998/02/10chal.html>`_, seems to have predated popular use of the term:
