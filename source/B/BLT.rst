.. _BLT:

BLT
============================================================

/B·L·T/, /bl\@t/, /belt/, n\.,vt\.

Synonym for :ref:`blit`\.
This is the original form of :ref:`blit` and the ancestor of :ref:`bitblt`\.
It referred to any large bit-field copy or move operation (one resource-intensive memory-shuffling operation done on pre-paged versions of ITS, WAITS, and TOPS-10 was sardonically referred to as "The Big BLT").
The jargon usage has outlasted the :ref:`PDP-10` BLock Transfer instruction from which :ref:`BLT` derives; nowadays, the assembler mnemonic :ref:`BLT` almost always means "Branch if Less Than zero".
