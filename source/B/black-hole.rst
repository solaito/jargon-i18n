n\.,vt\.

[common] What data (a piece of email or netnews, or a stream of TCP/IP packets) has fallen into if it disappears mysteriously between its origin and destination sites (that is, without returning a :ref:`bounce-message`\).
"I think there's a black hole at :code:`foovax`\!"
conveys suspicion that site :samp:`foovax` has been dropping a lot of stuff on the floor lately (see :ref:`drop-on-the-floor`\).
The implied metaphor of email as interstellar travel is interesting in itself.
Readily verbed as blackhole: "That router is blackholing IDP packets."
Compare :ref:`bit-bucket` and see :ref:`RBL`\.
