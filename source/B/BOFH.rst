//, n\.

[common] Acronym, Bastard Operator From Hell.
A system administrator with absolutely no tolerance for :ref:`luser`\s.
"You say you need more filespace?
<massive-global-delete> Seems to me you have plenty left..." Many BOFHs (and others who would be BOFHs if they could get away with it) hang out in the newsgroup :samp:`alt.sysadmin.recovery`\, although there has also been created a top-level newsgroup hierarchy ( :samp:`bofh.\*`\) of their own.

Several people have written stories about BOFHs.
The set usually considered canonical is by Simon Travaglia and may be found at the `Bastard Home Page <http://bofh.ntk.net/Bastard.html>`_.
BOFHs and BOFH wannabes hang out on :ref:`scary-devil-monastery` and wield :ref:`LART`\s.
