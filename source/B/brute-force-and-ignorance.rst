n\.

A popular design technique at many software houses â€” :ref:`brute-force` coding unrelieved by any knowledge of how problems have been previously solved in elegant ways.
Dogmatic adherence to design methodologies tends to encourage this sort of thing.
Characteristic of early :ref:`larval-stage` programming; unfortunately, many never outgrow it.
Often abbreviated BFI: "Gak, they used a :ref:`bubble-sort`\!
That's strictly from BFI."
Compare :ref:`bogosity`\.
A very similar usage is said to be mainstream in Great Britain.
