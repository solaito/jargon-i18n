n\.

(alt.
: bit diddling or :ref:`bit-twiddling`\) Term used to describe any of several kinds of low-level programming characterized by manipulation of :ref:`bit`\, :ref:`flag`\, :ref:`nybble`\, and other smaller-than-character-sized pieces of data; these include low-level device control, encryption algorithms, checksum and error-correcting codes, hash functions, some flavors of graphics programming (see :ref:`bitblt`\), and assembler/compiler code generation.
May connote either tedium or a real technical challenge (more usually the former).
"The command decoding for the new tape driver looks pretty solid but the bit-bashing for the control registers still has bugs."
