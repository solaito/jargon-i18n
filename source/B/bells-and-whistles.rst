bells and whistles

n\.

[common] Features added to a program or system to make it more :ref:`flavorful` from a hacker's point of view, without necessarily adding to its utility for its primary function.
Distinguished from :ref:`chrome`\, which is intended to attract users.
"Now that we've got the basic program working, let's go back and add some bells and whistles."
No one seems to know what distinguishes a bell from a whistle.
The recognized emphatic form is "bells, whistles, and gongs".

It used to be thought that this term derived from the toyboxes on theater organs.
However, the "and gongs" strongly suggests a different origin, at sea.
Before powered horns, ships routinely used bells, whistles, and gongs to signal each other over longer distances than voice can carry.
