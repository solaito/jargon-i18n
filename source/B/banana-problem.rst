banana problem

n\.

[from the story of the little girl who said "I know how to spell ‘banana’, but I don't know when to stop"].
Not knowing where or when to bring a production to a close (compare :ref:`fencepost-error`\).
One may say there is a banana problem of an algorithm with poorly defined or incorrect termination conditions, or in discussing the evolution of a design that may be succumbing to featuritis (see also :ref:`creeping-elegance`\, :ref:`creeping-featuritis`\).
See item 176 under :ref:`HAKMEM`\, which describes a banana problem in a :ref:`Dissociated-Press` implementation.
Also, see :ref:`one-banana-problem` for a superficially similar but unrelated usage.
