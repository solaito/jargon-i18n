============================================================
buried treasure
============================================================

n\.

A surprising piece of code found in some program.
While usually not wrong, it tends to vary from :ref:`crufty` to :ref:`bletcherous`\, and has lain undiscovered only because it was functionally correct, however horrible it is.
Used sarcastically, because what is found is anything *but* treasure.
Buried treasure almost always needs to be dug up and removed.
"I just found that the scheduler sorts its queue using :ref:`bubble-sort`\!
Buried treasure!"
