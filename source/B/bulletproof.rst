adj\.

Used of an algorithm or implementation considered extremely :ref:`robust`\; lossage-resistant; capable of correctly recovering from any imaginable exception condition â€” a rare and valued quality.

Thus, in some cases, this can imply code that is too heavyweight, due to excessive paranoia on the part of the programmer.
Syn.
