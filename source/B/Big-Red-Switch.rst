Big Red Switch
============================================================

n\.

[IBM] The power switch on a computer, esp.
the ‘Emergency Pull’ switch on an IBM :ref:`mainframe` or the power switch on an IBM PC where it really is large and red.
"This !
\@%$% :ref:`bitty-box` is hung again; time to hit the Big Red Switch."
Sources at IBM report that, in tune with the company's passion for :ref:`TLA`\s, this is often abbreviated as BRS (this has also become established on FidoNet and in the PC :ref:`clone` world).
It is alleged that the emergency pull switch on an IBM 360/91 actually fired a non-conducting bolt into the main power feed; the BRSes on more recent mainframes physically drop a block into place so that they can't be pushed back in.
People get fired for pulling them, especially inappropriately (see also :ref:`molly-guard`\).
