BogoMIPS

/bo´go·mips/, n\.

The number of million times a second a processor can do absolutely nothing.
The :ref:`Linux` OS measures BogoMIPS at startup in order to calibrate some soft timing loops that will be used later on; details at `the BogoMIPS mini-HOWTO <http://www.clifton.nl/>`_.
The name Linus chose, of course, is an ironic comment on the uselessness of all *other* :ref:`MIPS` figures.
