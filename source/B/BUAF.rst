//, n\.

[abbreviation, from :samp:`alt.fan.warlord`\] Big Ugly ASCII Font â€” a special form of :ref:`ASCII-art`\.
Various programs exist for rendering text strings into block, bloob, and pseudo-script fonts in cells between four and six character cells on a side; this is smaller than the letters generated by older :ref:`banner` (sense 2) programs.
These are sometimes used to render one's name in a :ref:`sig-block`\, and are critically referred to as BUAFs.
See :ref:`warlording`\.
