/bik´see/, n\.

Variant :ref:`emoticon`\s used BIX (the BIX Information eXchange); the term survived the demise of BIX itself.
The most common ( :ref:`smiley`\) bixie is <@_@>, representing two cartoon eyes and a mouth.
These were originally invented in an SF fanzine called APA-L and imported to BIX by one of the earliest users.
