/boh·go´s\@·tee/, n\.

1.
   [orig.
   CMU, now very common] The degree to which something is :ref:`bogus`\.
   Bogosity is measured with a :ref:`bogometer`\; in a seminar, when a speaker says something bogus, a listener might raise his hand and say "My bogometer just triggered".
   More extremely, "You just pinned my bogometer" means you just said or did something so outrageously bogus that it is off the scale, pinning the bogometer needle at the highest possible reading (one might also say "You just redlined my bogometer").
   The agreed-upon unit of bogosity is the :ref:`microLenat`\.

2.
   The potential field generated by a :ref:`bogon-flux`\; see :ref:`quantum-bogodynamics`\.
   See also :ref:`bogon-flux`\, :ref:`bogon-filter`\, :ref:`bogus`\.
