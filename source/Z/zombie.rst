zombie
============================================================

n\.

1.
   [Unix] A process that has died but has not yet relinquished its process table slot (because the parent process hasn't executed a :manpage:`wait(2)` for it yet).
   These can be seen in :manpage:`ps(1)` listings occasionally.
   Compare :ref:`orphan`\.

2.
   A machine, especially someone's :ref:`home-box`\, that has been cracked and is being used as part of a second-stage attack by miscreants trying to mask their home IP address.
   Especially used of machines being exploited in large gangs for a mechanized denial-of-service attack like Tribe Flood Network; the image that goes with this is of a veritable army of zombies mindlessly doing the bidding of a necromancer.
