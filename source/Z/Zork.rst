The second of the great early experiments in computer fantasy gaming; see :ref:`ADVENT`\.
Originally written on MIT-DM during 1977-1979, later distributed with BSD Unix (as a patched, sourceless RT-11 FORTRAN binary; see :ref:`retrocomputing`\) and commercialized as ‘The Zork Trilogy’ by :ref:`Infocom`\.
The FORTRAN source was later rewritten for portability and released to Usenet under the name "Dungeon".
Both FORTRAN "Dungeon" and translated C versions are available at many FTP sites; the commercial Zork trilogy is available at `http://www.ifarchive.org/ <http://www.ifarchive.org/>`_.
